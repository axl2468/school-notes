### Instructions
---
To use this with Obsidian, do
```sh
git clone https://github.com/axl2468/school-notes.git
```
then open the resulting folder as a vault in Obsidian.

Alternatively, just open the PDF folder to view the final notes (lol). Can't get PDFs to support linking yet, though (will try to fix this later).
