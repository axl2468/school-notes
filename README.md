### Instructions
---
To use this with Obsidian, do
```sh
git clone https://github.com/axl2468/school-notes.git
```
then open the resulting folder as a vault in Obsidian.

Alternatively, just open the PDF folder to view the final notes (lol). Can't get PDFs to support linking yet, though (will try to fix this later).
### TODO
---
1. Export PDFs of:
	- PHYS 111
		- [ ] Complex Numbers
		- [ ] Arithmetic Operations of Complex Numbers
2. Complete notes for:
	- PHYS 111
		- [x] Complex Numbers
