Art by Yasmina Reza
- The Tree (1964, Agnes Martin)
- "When I first made a grid I happened to be thinking of the innocence of trees and then this grid came into my mind and I thought it represented innocence, and I still do, and so I painted it and then I was satisfied. I thought, this is my vision."
#### Art as Imitation
Plato's Theory of Art
- Imitation of Imitation (Theory of Forms)
- Two realms of existence more real than art objects:
	- The forms themselves
	- The things of daily life
- Goal of art is the imitation of reality
- The artist is less attuned to reality than the craftsperson
	- The latter seeks to copy the form, the former considers the everyday as a model
The Republic
- Artists must be separated from the ideal state (Theory/World of Forms)
Forms
- Non Physical realm
- Considered as perfect, timeless, unchanging (ideal)
- Aim for perfection
Physical
- Physical realm/our world
- Not perfect, not timeless, not unchanging (non-ideal)
Craftsperson
- Directly copies the forms
Artists
- Creates based on the physical realm/our world (copies the copy of the world of forms)
#### Art as Cognition
Aristotle sees art as representational.
Meaning, art has the ability to teach. (note: this part is implied and not explicitly introduced)

Nietzche:
- Argues that all art is a response to the horrors of existence
- Two types of art:
	- Appolline/Apollonian
		- Dream, idealized realm
		- Order, ideas, rational, logic, mind
	- Dionysiac/Dionysian
		- Intoxicates and dissolves individuality
		- Chaos, emotions, irrational, instinct, body
#### Art as Communication of Feeling
(Leo Tolstoy)
- Similar to Aristotle's theory
Example:
- Art starts when creator explains the tree painting
- The feelings that come with that articulation
#### Art as Symptom
(Sigmund Freud)
- "We are all born queer"
- Psychoanalytical-focused explanation for why we do
- Art is medium for psychoanalysis

Agnes:
- As a child, would hear constant ringing in her mind
- Had schizophrenia
- (Maybe) painted to make sense of her mind
#### Art as a Significant Form
(Clive Bell)
- Formalist, liked Plato
- Art has to embody significant form
- Cubism

What is significant form?:
- Collection of lines, planes, etc.
- Should elicit strong feelings
- Agnes' painting falls under this
#### Art as Expression
(Robin George Collingwood)
- Artists only know what they're feeling (or what they wish to express) during the creation (not before)
- Agnes' painting falls under this
#### Art as Experience
(John Dewey)
- Experience: existence, everyday life
- Art cannot be defined but also cannot be everything all at once
- A distance must be discerned
- Art exists in our lives, but it must fulfill some requirements:
	- We must feel satisfied after completion
	- A marriage between hatred and joy
#### Art as Auratic
(Walter Benjamin)
- My love, my pookie bear, my everything
- "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical/Technological Reproduction"
- The reproducibility of artworks has caused their aura to decline
- Distinguishes:
	- Cult Value
		- Its place within a cult as a unique object hidden from view
		- "Gatekept"
	- Exhibition Value
		- Its worth as an object accessible to all
- The cult value *recedes* in favor of its exhibition value
- +10000000000 aura
- The moment you take a photo (or reproduce it), it reduces the "aura" of the art
	- Takes it from the space of the cult value into the space of exhibition value
- Inspired by Das Kapital (Karl Marx)
	- Value in a capitalist society -> you want it, you *need* it
	- In a capitalist society: you need to keep producing
	- Exhibition Value -> Art is in the market already
- Benjamin preferred prioritizing exhibition value
	- Art is dialectic
	- Exhibit in service of the masses
- Benjamin preferred prioritizin
#### Art as Liberatory
(Theodor Adorno)
- Requirements for art to be liberatory:
	- Source of entertainment (lightheartedness)
	- Source of seriousness (revolutionary)
- Art is dialectic (like Benjamin)
- In defense of personal and collective interests
#### Art as Indefinable
(Morris Weitz)
- Inspired by philosopher Ludwig Polz(?)
	- To understand language and words within that language, you must look at the family tree (and its resemblances in that tree)
- "Philosophical Investigations"
- Multiple similar yet also different definitions and understanding
- Art is forever undefinable today and in the future
	- Infinite quantity of descriptions of what art is
- Art should be understood as an "open concept"
#### Art as Exemplification
(Nelson Goodman)
- Linguist, formalist
- When is art?
	- When it is a painting that hangs at a museum?
	- etc?
- Art possesses symbolic qualities in different concepts
- Not as formalist as Clive - has a sense of fluidity
#### Art as Theory & Institution
(Arthur Danto & George Dickie, respectively)
Arthur Danto:
- Indistinguishable counterpart
	- Why is (Object A) art while (Object B) just a household item?
	- Andy Warhol (Brillo box) (the box can fulfill both the roles of Object A and Object B)
- The aforementioned is present because of the presence of theory in the art world
- Art world
	- Us people playing a role in that space
	- Requires education (e.g. art history, etc.)
	- Art becomes art when it is subjected to theory
Georgie Dickie:
- The art world is a social institution
	- We are propelled to continue preserving current art traditions/practices
	- Teaching, talking about art, buying and selling art, etc.
- E.g. Urinal became art when it was signed
	- Fountain - Marcel Duchamp (signed R. Mutt)
- Art becomes art when it is defined as art
#### Art as Aesthetic Production
(Monroe C. Beardsley)
- Formalist (Clive Bell-ish)
- To consider a work of art:
	- What is the aesthetic interest of the audience?
	- Art become art when that aesthetic interest is met (when it is on the market)
- Its not the object, its the interest
	- Crucial in selection process
	- Perspective of a historian: what works will you preserve and write about?
#### Art as Make-Believe
(Kendall Walton)
- Encourages readers to imagine what we had when we were children playing games
	- Props structure a child's play
	- Without a prop, no imaginative process, no worldbuilding
	- Psychology-related (not really connected to art tho??? - Arielle)
- Given example thru Mona Lisa:
	- Gesture of hand on the other hand
	- The hand is a prop (without this, we would not be able to perceive the painting of the woman)
	- ?????????????????????????????????????
#### Art as Fetish
(Adrien Piper)
- Attacks Benjamin's philosophy
- Art can only be encountered as separate from everyday things
	- Something to be fetishized
- In defense of performance art
	- Smallest audience member - required to keep the essence
- Exclusivity and selectivity
#### Art as Feminism
(Carolyn Korsmeyer)
- Art is craft - items that existed in the lives of women
- Slogan of 2nd Wave Feminism: "Personal is Political"
- They need to be seen (in all of their facets) to be understood
#### Art as Cultural Production
(Pierre Bo?)
- Marxist
- Labor in producing the object must be the same as the value of it in the market
- Does not give a definition, only shows the truth (to be an artist, you need to accept that labour will always be inferior)
- the artist is disposable :(
#### Art as Contextual & Postcolonial
(Dele Jegede & Kwame Anthonyappial?, respectively)
- Picasso was heavily inspired by masks
- We dissect the artwork and the message of the artist
- The moment we read/analyze/look at it/form our interpretation
	- We contextualize the message
	- While decontextualizing the art piece
Postcolonial
- Fixated on the context of African art (being displayed in a glass enclosure)
- e.g. Whang-od
- The disparity between the local and the western
- If we refuse to exhibit the art, it defeats the purpose of the art economy
#### Art as Virtual
(Douglas Daus)
- Agrees with Benjamin on the note of aura
- The moment you subject an object/item to technology, we embue a new aura in the virtual art
- If the digital counterpart of art is as stable as original, the newly acquired identity as original as the original
- Editing software:
	- e.g. if I edit the Mona Lisa to look like my sister - it becomes original because it is individualized
