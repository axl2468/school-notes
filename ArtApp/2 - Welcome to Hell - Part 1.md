Art by Yasmina Reza
- The Tree (1964, Agnes Martin)
- "When I first made a grid I happened to be thinking of the innocence of trees and then this grid came into my mind and I thought it represented innocence, and I still do, and so I painted it and then I was satisfied. I thought, this is my vision."
#### Art as Imitation
Plato's Theory of Art
- Imitation of Imitation (Theory of Forms)
- Two realms of existence more real than art objects:
	- The forms themselves
	- The things of daily life
- Goal of art is the imitation of reality
- The artist is less attuned to reality than the craftsperson
	- The latter seeks to copy the form, the former considers the everyday as a model
The Republic
- Artists must be separated from the ideal state (Theory/World of Forms)
Forms
- Non Physical realm
- Considered as perfect, timeless, unchanging (ideal)
- Aim for perfection
Physical
- Physical realm/our world
- Not perfect, not timeless, not unchanging (non-ideal)
Craftsperson
- Directly copies the forms
Artists
- Creates based on the physical realm/our world (copies the copy of the world of forms)
#### Art as Cognition
Aristotle sees art as representational.
Meaning, art has the ability to teach. (note: this part is implied and not explicitly introduced)

Nietzche:
- Argues that all art is a response to the horrors of existence
- Two types of art:
	- Appolline/Apollonian
		- Dream, idealized realm
		- Order, ideas, rational, logic, mind
	- Dionysiac/Dionysian
		- Intoxicates and dissolves individuality
		- Chaos, emotions, irrational, instinct, body
#### Art as Communication of Feeling
(Leo Tolstoy)
- Similar to Aristotle's theory
Example:
- Art starts when creator explains the tree painting
- The feelings that come with that articulation
#### Art as Symptom
(Sigmund Freud)
- "We are all born queer"
- Psychoanalytical-focused explanation for why we do
- Art is medium for psychoanalysis

Agnes:
- As a child, would hear constant ringing in her mind
- Had schizophrenia
- (Maybe) painted to make sense of her mind
#### Art as a Significant Form
(Clive Bell)
- Formalist, liked Plato
- Art has to embody significant form
- Cubism

What is significant form?:
- Collection of lines, planes, etc.
- Should elicit strong feelings
- Agnes' painting falls under this
#### Art as Expression
(Robin George Collingwood)
- Artists only know what they're feeling (or what they wish to express) during the creation (not before)
- Agnes' painting falls under this
#### Art as Experience
(John Dewey)
- Experience: existence, everyday life
- Art cannot be defined but also cannot be everything all at once
- A distance must be discerned
- Art exists in our lives, but it must fulfill some requirements:
	- We must feel satisfied after completion
	- A marriage between hatred and joy
#### Art as Auratic
(Walter Benjamin)
- My love, my pookie bear, my everything
- "The Work of Art in the Age of Reproduction"
- The reproducibility of artworks has caused their aura to decline
- Distinguishes:
	- Cult Value
		- Its place within a cult as a unique object hidden from view
	- Exhibition Value
		- Its worth as an object accessible to all
- The cult value *recedes* in favor of its exhibition value
- +10000000000 aura
- The moment you take a photo (or reproduce it), it reduces the "aura" of the art
