It was a fairly cold, humid night in a small humble barrio in the mountainous Camarines Sur. It had just finished raining, and the clouds were just beginning to part. In front of my lola's house there was an old elementary school with a small field of grass. There I stood in silence, looking up.

I love space. I love astronomy. This passion is what kept me going through the enormous amount of crap that I had to wade through as a Physics student. Stargazing was one of those hobbies that I wanted to do. Problem was, I lived in Metro Manila.

One couldn't imagine the excitement that I had when I learned that we were going to visit my mom's hometown. A perfect stargazing location. For the longest time I was waiting for an opportunity like this.

As the clouds dissipated into nothing, I was greeted by such a sight.

A field of brilliant stars, dotted across the vast blank dark canvas of the night sky. Photons from a long, arduous journey (from origins of a distance that the human mind can't even begin to comprehend) going all the way into my eyes.

Each sun radiated its own individual tinge of colour (mostly white, but different shades regardless) and twinkle, broadcasting its unique existence towards the fringes of the universe.

It's kind of unfair, you don't see this type of thing in Metro Manila.
