Author's Note:
Here lies an abode of whatever my creative juices were able to pump out.

Poems, prose, rambling, doodles, and other stuff galore.

probably shit. I love art, but I haven't been exercising my artistic side, okay?

blame math.

Laozi says: “There is no greater crime than desire.”
Buddha says: “There is dukkha (suffering) when there is desire.”
I say: “But I want her so fucking bad!”

**The Leftover Dinner Club**
(A prose? A song? A free-form poem? Quite honestly, im not sure)

I love my dad, but sometimes he can be a bit much.

He keeps nudging us into wealth-building.

I have the smarts? Start a business.
I know how to do something? Make money off it.
Team Payaman? If they make money off vlogging, so can you!
Elon Musk? Work for SpaceX, ~~meatride~~ get his favor!
Andrew Tate? Sign up for Hustler's University!
Crypto? Invest in NFTs!
Profit profit profit!
Money money money!

I know he just wants the best for us.
I wouldn't want my children to suffer either.
Just for us to taste the sweet nectar of wealth. The comfort and stability that he has been denied of for decades.

Innocent intentions, but I hate the implications.
He's been poisoned by the hustle culture. I don't blame him.

Facebook, god damn it.
Reagan and Thatcher - *fuck* both of you. Burn in hell.
