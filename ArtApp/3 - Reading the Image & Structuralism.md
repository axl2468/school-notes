### Reading the Image
- by Alice Guillermo
- Introduction to "Image to Meaning" (published in Ateneo ;))
#### What is an image?
- Alice uses a traditional definition
#### Basic Documentary Information:
1. Title of the work (signifier)
2. Artist's Name (signifier)
3. Medium and technique
4. Date of work
5. Dimensions
#### Four Planes of Analysis
- Based on Ferdinand de Saussuse
	- Created the term "semiotics" under "semiology"
	- Started the structuralism movement
		- Focuses on arrangements and systems of logic
		- To arrive to intended meaning
	- Sign system
		- Signifier - physical manifestation (text, utterance, etc.)
		- Signified - entails meaning/symbol behind the signifier (mental - the sound image)
	- Art may be interpreted under semiotic thought
1. Basic semiotic plane
2. Iconic plane (or image itself)
3. Contextual plane
4. Evaluative plane
#### Mistakes :(
- At the end of the day, the audience has no voice
	- Language is always in flux, bawal ikahon
	- Death of the Author
- "Image to Meaning"
	- Recognizing that language is precise, then there is no such thing as arriving at meanings (due to language being always in flux)

### Structuralism/Post-structuralism
#### Rhetoric of the Image
(Roland Barthes)
1. The linguistic message
	- Captions available on surface of image
2. The iconic
	 - Take into account the feelings
3. The denotated message

- What you are reading is no longer a fixed image, now a text
	- May take in your analysis
	- At the end of the day, it "vomits" out your message and empties itself for a new interpretation
- Text continues to live on, autonomous (endless like a black hole and gojo's infinity xd)
	- It is what it is
#### From Work to Text

#### Jacques Derrida
- Deconstruction
- Differance
	- Both in difference and act of deferring
	- Temporization
- Attacked logoism (attacking Plato)
Steps
1. Locating/Situating a binary opposition
	- In writing and speech
2. Privilege the underprivileged term of the binary
	- Writing > speech (as speech is more privileged)
	- Does not necessarily mean that writing is superior (only given as an example of prove a point)
3. They differ but also embody similarities (no writing w/out speech)
	- As such, should not be binary opposition in the first place
	- my head hurts
- Family resemblance can be applied here
Another example:
Car
1. My car acquires a different identity from your car

- Language can never fully satisfy us human beings (our desire to collect symbols/logos)
- Context: Derrida was Jewish -> in defense of the black sheep, inversion of the system
- Listen to everyone

### [[Bluet|Bluets]]
- Creative nonfiction
	- Fourth genre, together w/ poetry, fiction, and drama
	- Umbrella term for works like personal essay, biography, narrative history, long form narrative reportage, etc.
	- Outgrowth to the genre, like speculative nonfiction and visual essay
- Assemblage
	- Intertextuality - mashing different texts together to arrive at various connotations
	- Sort of reads like an essay, artist book, poem, etc. all at once
	- Better connotation than "experimental" lol
- "Braided essay"
	- Narrative 1: Philosophical extravaganza
	- Narrative 2: The horny bits
	- Narrative 3: One-liners (not referring to anything else)
	- Narrative 4: The friend (only appears by the latter part)
	- Actually follows a pattern?!?!?!?!!??!?!?!?!?!??!?!
- Poetry collection

Debate about creative nonfiction vs nonfiction
- Nonfiction -> everything is factual, nothing made up
- Everything is muddied due to "creative nonfiction"
- Bluets ends up in "creative nonfiction"
- Nonfiction must follow a storyline, a narrative (rules out stuff like science books)
- If we try to disregard creative nonfiction, ignores how some pieces of work can "play" among different genres
	- Nonfiction entails rigidness, formality

Wave Books' description of Bluets:
- A lyricial, philosophical, and often explicit exploration of personal suffering and the limitations of vision and love, as refracted through the color blue, while folding in, and responding to, the divergent voices and preoccupations of such generative figures as Wittgenstein, Sel Shonagon, William Gass and Joan Mitchell. Bluets further confirms Maggie Nelson's place within the pantheon of brilliant lyric essayists
- Lyric essay?
	- Creates a negative connotation among formalists

Solution:
- Bluets is a fragmented work

#### Maggie Nelson
- Not entirely broken? Has an SO
	- Bihirang masulat ang kaligayahan - Rebecca T. Anonuevo
- Considered more of a poet rather than an essayist
	- But is really trained as an essayist

#### Profanity
What is the purpose of profanity
- Purely by accident or an informed choice?
- Profanity to impose power
- Profanity to inflict pain
-
