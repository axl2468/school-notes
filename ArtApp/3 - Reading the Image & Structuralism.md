### Reading the Image
- by Alice Guillermo
- Introduction to "Image to Meaning" (published in Ateneo ;))
#### What is an image?
- Alice uses a traditional definition
#### Basic Documentary Information:
1. Title of the work (signifier)
2. Artist's Name (signifier)
3. Medium and technique
4. Date of work
5. Dimensions
#### Four Planes of Analysis
- Based on Ferdinand de Saussuse
	- Created the term "semiotics" under "semiology"
	- Started the structuralism movement
		- Focuses on arrangements and systems of logic
		- To arrive to intended meaning
	- Sign system
		- Signifier - physical manifestation (text, utterance, etc.)
		- Signified - entails meaning/symbol behind the signifier (mental - the sound image)
	- Art may be interpreted under semiotic thought
1. Basic semiotic plane
2. Iconic plane (or image itself)
3. Contextual plane
4. Evaluative plane
#### Mistakes :(
- At the end of the day, the audience has no voice
	- Language is always in flux, bawal ikahon
	- Death of the Author
- "Image to Meaning"
	- Recognizing that language is precise, then there is no such thing as arriving at meanings (due to language being always in flux)

### Structuralism/Post-structuralism
#### Rhetoric of the Image
(Roland Barthes)
1. The linguistic message
	- Captions available on surface of image
2. The iconic
	 - Take into account the feelings
3. The denotated message

- What you are reading is no longer a fixed image, now a text
	- May take in your analysis
	- At the end of the day, it "vomits" out your message and empties itself for a new interpretation
- Text continues to live on, autonomous (endless like a black hole and gojo's infinity xd)
	- It is what it is
#### From Work to Text

#### Jacques Derrida
- Deconstruction
- Differance
	- Both in difference and act of deferring
	- Temporization
- Attacked logoism (attacking Plato)
Steps
1. Locating/Situating a binary opposition
	- In writing and speech
2. Privilege the underprivileged term of the binary
	- Writing > speech (as speech is more privileged)
	- Does not necessarily mean that writing is superior (only given as an example of prove a point)
3. They differ but also embody similarities (no writing w/out speech)
	- As such, should not be binary opposition in the first place
	- my head hurts
- Family resemblance can be applied here
Another example:
Car
1. My car acquires a different identity from your car

- Language can never fully satisfy us human beings (our desire to collect symbols/logos)
- Context: Derrida was Jewish -> in defense of the black sheep, inversion of the system
- Listen to everyone
