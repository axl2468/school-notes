- "The period of the late 60s and early 70s is perceived as the breaking point offering a fresh perspective for creative production. This time marks the birth of the term 'contemporary art'. Some of the major movements that emerged here include conceptual, minimalism, performance, and installation art. There was a strong desire for change and the need to detach from the traditionalist approaches."
	- Andy Warhol comes to mind

For the Ancients...
- Art is not the concern of feelings and inspirations. It was not the business of Art to embody these things.
- "Art, on the other hand, was the domain of trained professionals, technicians."
- "to the very end of the ancient world art was equated with skill."
- "Emotions tarnish the artness of art"
