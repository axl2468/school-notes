Beauty has the capacity to locate. To choreograph, to camouflage, to soften. And yet, to trigger perverese articulations of problems of enormous proportion.

- Nothing original
- You are influenced by your environment

### Ways of Seeing
A child sees before they speak
- Or words first before seeing?

- No image will truly be authentic, there is always a level of performance associated with it

Key phrase: Capture a moment

We cherrypick elements in what we see and reorganize them to fit what we want
Liberty to modify, "rectify" mistakes in images

Photographs furnish evidence

War images lose their value the more they are viewed

Why do we believe in a photo?

Did you capture a moment?

What is a moment?

We can live in the moment, we can live in moments

Every moment (any moment) is already occurring as we speak - Susan

When you take a photo, you lose that moment

Taking photographs is either pleasurable or destructive, never both at the same time
