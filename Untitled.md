It is possible that Palma is exaggerating the American view of beauty contests, due to his status as president of UP - an institution still under US influence at the time. In addition, it would be generally advantageous for the university to participate in the contests on the business-side of things.

On the other hand, a more careful reading shows that this is not the case at all. For example, his comparisons of the beauty pageants to art, sculptures, and paintings may be exaggerated and stretched to imply the objectification of women. He follows this up, however, with citing a concert and a theatrical presentation, dissolving this idea as it reintroduces the idea of art as a performance. This grounds the notion that there was no exaggeration in Palma's take, as he was merely interpreting beauty pageants in a different (and valid) perspective.

There was also an objective truth in his implied importance of the Philippine Carnival: as shown in the assigned reading, the Carnival was originally made by the Americans to broadcast the Philippines' "economic progress" in the international sphere. Coupled with how the pageant eventually transformed into a rallying point for a national Filipino identity and the inner racial conflict that existed between the Americans and the Filipinos, one can see the important political influence that it had (such that it carried over to even the present day).

Given a publicized platform like beauty pageants, Palma asserts that there are advantages to be gained for Filipinos regardless of its intended purpose.
