In functions with more than one variables, it is possible to find its derivative with respect to only one of those variables, while holding the others as constants.

e.g. Given the function
$$
y(x,t) = 2x^2t^2
$$
you can find the derivative either with respect to $x$ or $t$.

If with respect to $x$:
$$
\frac{\delta y(x,t)}{\delta x} = 4xt^2
$$
If with respect to $t$:
$$
\frac{\delta y(x,t)}{\delta t} = 4x^2t
$$
This can done up to multiple orders.
