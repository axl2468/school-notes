Given a function $f(x,y)$, it is homogeneous if we are able to multiply each variable by arbitrary variable $z$ (such that $f(zx, zy)$) and then rearrange it to get a function in the form $z^nf(x,y)$.
### Degree
Refers to the exponent of $z$ after we rearrange the homogeneous function.
#### Example
$$
\begin{align}
f(x,y) &= x+3y \\
f(zx,zy) &= zx+3zy \\
&= z(x+3y) \\
&= z f(x,y)
\end{align}
$$
We then have a degree of 1.
