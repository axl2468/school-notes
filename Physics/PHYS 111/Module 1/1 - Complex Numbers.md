## Imaginary Numbers
Composed of imaginary unit:
$$\sqrt{-1} = i$$
For example, $\sqrt{-9}$ may be represented as:
$$\sqrt{-9} = \sqrt{-1} \cdot \sqrt{9} = \pm3i$$
Which is true because
$$(-3i)(-3i) = 9i^2 = -9$$
where $i^2 = -1$

## Complex Numbers
Complex numbers are represented in the form
$$z = x+iy$$
where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers.

### Complex Number Functions
Functions can be used to determine the coefficients of the real and imaginary parts of a complex number.

The real part of any number $z$ can be determined through
$$Re(z) = x$$
while the imaginary part of $z$ can be determined through
$$Im(z) = y$$
**Example**
Given imaginary number $z_1 = 2+3i$,
$$
\begin{aligned}
	Re(z_1) = 2 \\
	Im(z_1) = 3
\end{aligned}
$$
Similar to regular numbers, [[2 - Arithmetic Operations of Complex Numbers|basic arithmetic operations]] can be done on complex numbers.
