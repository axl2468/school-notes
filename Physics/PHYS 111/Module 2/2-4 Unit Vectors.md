#### Definition:
If $\left| \vec{a} \right| = 1$, then we can say that $\vec{a}$ is a unit vector. (Alternatively, we can express it as $\vec{a} \, \cdot \, \vec{a} = 1$.)

### Finding a unit vector
To get a magnitude of 1, we want there to be a denominator that is equal to the square root of the sum of the original components (so that they cancel out when the sum of the new vector is squared). Therefore, for any vector $\vec{v}$:

$$
\text{Unit Vector} = \frac{\vec{v}}{\sqrt{\sum v_i}}
$$
