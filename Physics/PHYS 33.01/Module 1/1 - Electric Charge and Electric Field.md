Besides gravity, mass has another property: electric charge.

### 1.1 Electric Interactions
e.g. plastic rods rubbed on fur, glass rods rubbed on silk
There are two types of interactions:
- Attraction
- Repulsion
### 1.2 Electrical Charge and Structure of Matter
There are two kinds of electric charges:
- Negative charge, possessed by electrons
- Positive charge, possessed by protons

Opposite signs attract, same signs repel.

The electric charge $q$ is said to be quantized, i.e. electriccharge exists as discrete packets.

$$
q = Ne
$$
where $N$ is an integer, $e$ is the fundamental unit of charge ($1.6\times 10^{-19} \, C$)

In nature, atoms are normally found with equal protons and electrons, making them electrically neutral. By removing or adding electrons, it acquires a net electric charge equal to $e$ multiplied the number of electrons added/removed $N$.

Note that typical charges are given in the $\mu C$ ($1 \times 10^{-6} \, C$)

### 1.3 Conductors, Insulators, and Induced Charge
It is possible to transfer electric charge from one object to another as no electric charge is created nor destroyed.

#### 1.3.1 Conduction and Insulation
Not only can electric charge exists on an object, but it can also move through an object. How readily an object allows charges to flow through it (conductivity) varies.
##### Conductors
These are materials wherein some of the electrons are free electrons (loosely-bound electrons) (i.e. good conductivity).
e.g. metals
##### Insulators
Materials where all of the electrons are bound to atoms (i.e. poor conductivity).
e.g. glass, wood, rubber
##### Semiconductors
Between conductors and insulators, have their own specific properties.

#### 1.3.2 Methods of Inducing Charge
One method is through charging through contact.

Another method is through induction.

#### 1.3.3 Electrical Force on an Uncharged Object


### 1.4 Coulomb's Law
Remember that for gravity, attractive force is inversely proportional to the distance. This is the same for the attractive and repulsive forces, which is important to consider when talking about interactions between atoms in terms of its fundamental particles (electrons & protons).

#### 1.4.1 Interaction between charges
Unlike charges attract and like charge repel each other.
(pic)

By considering each individual force (the tension, gravity, and the unknown additional force), we can determine that additional force caused by charges. As mentioned earlier, we find that attractive/repulsive forces is inversely proportional to the distance between two point charges.

This relationship is defined through **coulomb's law**.

The force on $q_2$ by $q_1$:
$$
\vec{F}_{12} = k \frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}\hat{r}
$$
Meanwhile, the force on $q_1$ by $q_2$ (denoted by $\vec{F}_{21}$) is essentially the same magnitude, as
(pic)

where $k = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} = 8.99 \times 10^9 \, Nm^2 / C^2$ and $\epsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{12}$ (where we can approximate $k$ to $9.0 \times 10^9 Nm^2 / C^2$)

#### 1.4.2 Superposition of Forces
For three or more point charges.


In the gravitational field, we find that the gravitational field is defined by
$$
\frac{F}{m} = G \frac{M}{r^2}
$$
where $M$ is the mass of the gravitational source.
