### Thin Lenses
#### Converging Lens (Double Convex)
An optical system with two refracting surfaces, e.g. two spherical surfaces close together (of negligible thickness), such that the refraction only occurs at the center of the lenses.

Consider a lens of the shape as shown in the figure:
![[Figure34.28.PNG]]

When a beam of rays parallel to the axis passes through the lens, the rays converge to a point $F2$.

Triangles $PQO$ and $P'Q'O$ are similar so that the ratios of the corresponding sides are equal:
$$
\frac{y}{s} = -\frac{y'}{s'} \text{ or } \frac{y'}{y} = -\frac{s'}{s}
$$
And triangles $OAF_2$ and $P'Q'F_2$ are similar such that
$$
\frac{y}{f} = -\frac{y'}{s'-f} \text{ or } \frac{y'}{y} = -\frac{s'-f}{f}
$$
Then we should get
$$
\frac{1}{s} + \frac{1}{s'} = \frac{1}{f}
$$
#### Diverging Lens (Double Concave)
In these lenses, the beam of parallel light rays diverge after refraction. The focal length of these lenses are negative (i.e. "negative lens", reversed relative to that of a "positive lens").

### Graphical Methods for Lenses
Consider that the entire deviation of a ray as occurring at the midplane of the lens, consistent with the assumption that the distance between the lens surfaces is negligible.

Notice that the image is real in the converging lenses, while it is virtual in the diverging lenses.
