#### Wave fronts
Light is actually a nearly uncountable number of electromagnetic wave fronts, but an analysis of refraction or reflection are made possible by treating light as a ray.


### Specular and Diffuse Reflections
Note that the real surface will scatter and reflect light. Because of this, diffuse reflection is the rule, not the exception. However, specular reflection is used for ray approximation to simplify things.

### Index of Refraction
aka as refractive index (n). This is the ratio of speed of light $c$ in a vacuum to speed $v$ in a material, i.e.
$$
\begin{align}
n = \frac{c}{v} \tag{index of refraction}
\end{align}
$$
It should be noted that for a vacuum, $n = 1$. Light travels more slowly in a material than in a vacuum; hence, $n>1$ in any material other than vacuum

### Laws of Reflection and Refraction
The law of reflection states that
$$
\theta_\text{incidence} = \theta_\text{reflection} 
$$
Meanwhile, the Snell's Law of Refraction considers the slowing of light in a medium other than vacuum and relates it to the index of refraction. When a monochromatic light ray cross the interface between two given materials $a$ and $b$, the ray angles are related to them by:
$$
\frac{\sin\theta_a}{\sin\theta_b} = \frac{n_b}{n_a}
$$
where $n$ refers to the index of refraction and $\theta$ refers to the angle from the normal.
Alternatively:
$$
n_a\sin\theta_a = n_b\sin\theta_b
$$

### Index of Refraction and the Wave Aspects of Light
The frequency $f$ of light does not change when passing from one material to another (the number of wave cycles arriving per unit time is the same as the number of cycles leaving per unit time).

[[2 - Wave Velocity, Energy, Power, and Intensity|Recall]]:
$$
v = \lambda f
$$
Since $v$ changes, then that means that wavelength $\lambda$ varies in different materials.

This means that
$$
\begin{align}
f &= \frac{c}{\lambda_0} = \frac{v}{\lambda} \\
n &= \frac{c}{v}
\end{align}
$$
where $\lambda_0$ is the wavelength of light in a vacuum
Then
$$
\lambda = \frac{\lambda_0}{n}
$$
### Tabulated Indexes of Refraction
The index of refraction depends not only on the substance but also on the wavelength of light. The dependence of the refractive index on the wavelength is called **dispersion**.

This means that the index of refraction changes depending on the wavelength of light.
