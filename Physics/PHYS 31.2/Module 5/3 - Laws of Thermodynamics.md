### Thermodynamic Systems
We must define clearly what is and is not included in the thermodynamic system. The state of the thermodynamic system changes when it goes through a thermodynamic process.

### 1st Law of Thermodynamics
$$
\Delta U = Q-W
$$
where $U$ refers to the internal energy, $Q$ is heat, and $W$ is work done by the system.
