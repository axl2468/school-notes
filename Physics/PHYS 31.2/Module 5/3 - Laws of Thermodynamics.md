### Thermodynamic Systems
We must define clearly what is and is not included in the thermodynamic system. The state of the thermodynamic system changes when it goes through a thermodynamic process.

### 1st Law of Thermodynamics
$$
\Delta U = Q-W
$$
where $U$ refers to the internal energy, $Q$ is heat, and $W$ is work done by the system.

#### Work Done During Volume Changes
Consider the work done by the system during a volume change.

//tube

When a gas expands, it pushes outward on its boundary surfaces as they move outward. An expanding gas always does positive work.

Let
$A$: Cross sectional area of the cylinder
$p$ pressure exerted by the system at the piston face
$F = pA$ is the total force exerted by the system on the piston

//pic

When the piston moves a distance $dx$, then the work $dW$ by this force is:
$$
dW = F \, dx = pA \, dx
$$
But remember that
$$
A \, dx = dV \tag{infinitesimal change in volume}
$$
The work done by the system in this small volume change:
$$
dW = p \, dV
$$
In a finite volume change from $V_1$ to $V_2$:
$$
W = \int_{V_1}^{V_2} p \, dV
$$
In general, the pressure of the system may vary during the volume change. Let us try to find how the pressure varies as a function of volume using a pV-diagram (i.e. use the work formula to find the area under the pV curve):

#### Paths Between Thermodynamic States
When a thermodynamic system changes from an initial state to a final state, it passes through a series of intermediate states (paths).

This shows us that the work done by the system depends not only on the initial and final states, but also the intermediate states (i.e. the path)

However, what is

#### Internal Energy and the First Law of Thermodynamics
Internal energy refers to the sum of the kinetic energies of all the particles in a system, plus the sum of all the potential energy of interaction among particles.

Let $U$ be the internal energy of a thermodynamic system. Then $\Delta = U_2 - U_1$ is the change in internal energy.

There are two possible ways to change the internal energy of a system:
- Add/remove heat from the system
- Let the system do work or do work on the system

Then:
$$
\Delta U = Q - W
$$
or
$$
Q = \Delta U + W
$$
(Note that $W$ refers to work done by the system)

The first law of thermodynamics gives us an operational definition of the change in internal energy of a system.

In a thermodynamic process, the internal energy may:
- Increase ($\Delta U > 0$)
- Decrease ($\Delta < 0$)
- Remain the same ($\Delta = 0$)

Note that while $Q$ and $W$ are depends on the path, $\Delta = Q - W$ is independent of the path.

### Cyclic Processes and Isolated Systems
A cyclic process is a process that returns the system to its initial state.
