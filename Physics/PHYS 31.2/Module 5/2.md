### Ideal-Gas Equation
$$
pV = nRT
$$
where $R = 8.314$ J/mol K

In terms of mass of gas and molar mass $M$ where $m_\text{total} = nM$, then
$$
\begin{align}
pV &= \frac{m_\text{total}}{M} RT \\
\rho &= \frac{pM}{RT} \tag{using density formula}
\end{align}
$$

### Van Der Waals Equation
$$
\left( p+\frac{an^2}{V^2} \right)(V - nb) = nRT
$$
where b represents the volume of a mole of molecules and n is the number of moles.

### Avogadro's Number
The number of a molecules in a mole is Avogadro's number, $6.02214179 \times 10^{23}$ molecules/mol
and the molar mass M is the mass of 1 mole of a compound. This is equal to the mass m of a single molecule multiplied by Avogadro's number.

### Molecule collisions and Pressure
The change in the x-component of momentum of a single molecule is
$$
m|v_x| - (-m|v_x|) = 2m|v_x|
$$
and we have the volume of the cylinder
$$
V = A|v_x|dt
$$
from which we can get the number of molecules in the cylinder assuming that the number of molecules per unit volume is uniform (N/V):
$$
\left( \frac{N}{V} \right)A|v_x|dt
$$
On average, half the molecules would be moving towards the wall and the other half is away from it. Then the number of collisions with A during dt would be
$$
\frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{N}{V} \right)A|v_x|dt
$$

For the system of all molecules in the gas, then the total momentum change $dP_x$ during $dt$ should be
$$
dP_x = \frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{N}{V} \right)(A|v_x|dt)(2m|v_x|) = \frac{NAmv_x^2}{V}dt
$$
which then gives us the rate of change of momentum component $P_x$:

$$
\frac{dPx}{dt} = \frac{NAmv_x^2}{V}
$$

#### Pressure and Molecular Kinetic Energies
The speed $v$ of a molecule is related to the velocity components by
$$
v^2 = v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2
$$
and we can express the average over all molecules as
$$
(v^2)_\text{av} = (v_x^2)_\text{av} + (v_y^2)_\text{av} + (v_z^2)_\text{av}
$$
There shouldn't be any real difference between the x, y, and z-directions in the model, so we get
$$
(v_x^2)_\text{av} = \frac{1}{3}(v^2)_\text{av}
$$
Remember that pressure is the magnitude of the force exerted on the wall per unit area. Then we should get
$$
p = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{Nmv_x^2}{V}
$$
where we can get
$$
\begin{align}
pV &= \frac{1}{3}Nm(v^2)_\text{av} \\
&= \frac{2}{3}N\left[ \frac{1}{2} m(v^2)_\text{av} \right]
\end{align}
$$
Notice that the expression in the brackets is essentially the kinetic energy equation. Combining this with the ideal-gas equation, we should get
$$
\begin{align}
pV &= \frac{2}{3}K_\text{tr} = nRT \\
K_\text{tr} &= \frac{3}{2}nRT
\end{align}
$$
where we get the average translational kinetic energy of n moles of an ideal gas.

Note that we can also do
$$
\frac{1}{2}m(v^2)_\text{av} = \frac{3}{2}kT
$$
to get the average translational kinetic energy of a gas molecule, where $k$ is the Boltzmann's constant where
$$
k = \frac{R}{N_A} = 1.381 \times 10^{-23} \text{J/molecule K}
$$
From here we can get the root-mean-square speed $v_\text{rms}$ of a gas molecule through
$$
\begin{align}
v_\text{rms} &= \sqrt{(v^2)_\text{av}} \\
&= \sqrt{\frac{3kT}{m}} = \sqrt{ \frac{3RT}{M} }
\end{align}
$$
