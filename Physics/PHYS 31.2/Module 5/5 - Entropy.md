Entropy provides a quantitative measure of randomness. Examples of increasing randomness of natural processes include:
- Irreversible heat flow
- Addition of heat to a body
- Free expansion of a gas

Consider an infinitesimal isothermal expansion of an ideal gas (heat dQ is added and the gas expands just enough to keep the temperature constant). Since the U is constant (dU = 0), then
$$
dQ = dW = pdV = \frac{nRT}{V} dV
$$
so that
$$
\frac{dV}{V} = \frac{dQ}{nRT}
$$
We define dS as the infinitesimal change in entropy during an infinitesimal reversible process at absolute temperature T:
$$
dS = \frac{dQ}{T}
$$
If the total amount of heat Q is added during a reversible isothermal process at absolute temperature T, the total entropy change $\Delta S$ would be
$$
\Delta S = S_2 - S_1 = \frac{Q}{T}
$$
### In Reversible Processes (Not Necessarily Isothermal)
We generalize the definition of entropy change for any reversible processes leading from an initial state to a final state â€” regardless if its isothermal.

Imagine the process to be composed of a series of infinitesimal reversible steps. During a typical step, the infinitesimal quantity of heat dQ is added to a system at absolute temperature T. We then sum:
$$
\Delta s = \int_1^2 \frac{dQ}{T}
$$
Change in entropy $\Delta S$ does not depend on the path but is the same for all possible processes from state 1 to state 2. Since entropy is a function only of the state of a system, entropy changes can also be calculated for irreversible (nonequilibrium) processes.

This means that a gas that expands adiabatically and reversibly has zero change in entropy, i.e. it is also an isentropic process.

#### Entropy in Cyclic Process
The total entropy change during any reversible cycle is zero:
$$
\int \frac{dQ}{T} = 0
$$

### Entropy and Second Law
When all systems taking part in a process are included, the entropy either remains constant or increases. No process is possible where entropy decreases.
