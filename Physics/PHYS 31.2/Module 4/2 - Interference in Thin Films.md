### Constructive and Destructive Interference in Thin Films
Notice that bubbles often have "colorful reflections" on them. This occurs because when light is incident on thin films (such as that of bubbles), the waves are reflected from both the front and back surfaces of the films (see Figure below):

Due to this, constructive interference can occur between the two reflected waves of different path lengths and wavelengths.

The refractive index of the film would always be higher than that of air, so then we can consider
$$
\lambda_n = \frac{\lambda}{n}
$$
There would then be two different condition types.

#### Neither or Both Waves Have a Half-Cycle Phase Shift
For constructive reflection:
$$
2nt = m\lambda \tag{$m=0,1,2,\dots$}
$$
For destructive:
$$
2nt = \left( m+\frac{1}{2} \right)\lambda \tag{$m=0,1,2,\dots$}
$$
#### One Wave Has a Half-Cycle Phase Shift
Essentially, the conditions are swapped.
For constructive reflection:
$$
2t = \left(m+\frac{1}{2}\right)\lambda \tag{$m=0,1,2,\dots$}
$$
For destructive:
$$
2t = m\lambda \tag{$m=0,1,2,\dots$}
$$
