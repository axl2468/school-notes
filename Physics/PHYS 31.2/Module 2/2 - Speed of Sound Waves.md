### Speed of Sound in Fluids
#### Impulse-Momentum Theorem
![[Figure16.7.PNG]]
Remember that longitudinal momentum = $\text{mass} \times \Delta v$

The mass of the fluid set into motion from $t=0$ to $t>0$ would then be equivalent to
$$
\rho(\text{volume}) = \rho(Avt)
$$
We would then know that the longitudinal momentum is actually
$$
\text{Longitudinal momentum} = (\rho vtA)v_y
$$
From this, knowing that: 
$$
\text{longitudinal momentum} = \text{Net force} \times t = \Delta\rho At
$$
$$
B = \frac{-\text{Pressure change}}{\text{fractional volume change}} = \frac{-\Delta p}{-Av_yt/Avt} \,\, \text{and} \,\, \Delta p = B\frac{v_y}{v}
$$
Then we can then get
$$
v = \sqrt{\frac{B}{\rho}} \,\, \text{or} \,\, v = \sqrt{\frac{Y}{\rho}}
$$
where $B$ is the bulk modulus (for fluids) and $Y$ is the young's modulus (for solids). Notice that this still follows the same principle as seen in [[2 - Wave Velocity, Energy, Power, and Intensity|our original formula for velocity of a wave on a string]].

### Example Problem
A ship uses a sonar system to detect underwater objects. The system emits underwater sound waves and measures the time interval for the reflected wave (echo) to return to the detector. Determine the speed of sound waves in water and find the wavelength of a 262-Hz wave.
#### Solution:

### Temperature Dependence of Speed of Sound In Gas
Given the bulk modulus of the gas
$$
B = \gamma p_0
$$
where $\gamma$ is the heat capacity ratio and $p_0$ is the equilibrium gas pressure, then we get the speed of sound in gas as
$$
v = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma RT}{M}}
$$
where:
- $T$ = absolute temperature (K)
- $M$ = molar mass
- $R$ = gas constant, $8.314$ J/mole-K
- $\gamma$ = heat capacity ratio
