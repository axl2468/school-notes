Consider two speakers that emit identical sinusoidal sound waves.

At point $P$, the waves are in phase. Meanwhile, the waves are out of phase by $\frac{1}{2}$ at point $Q$.
This would mean that (given that each individual wave has amplitude $A$):
- At $P$, the total amplitude is $2A$ (constructive interference)
- At $Q$, the total amplitude is less than $A$ (destructive interference)

In general, constructive interference between two similar sinusoidal waves occurs when the path difference is in the form $n\lambda$ where $n$ should be an integer. Otherwise, destructive interference occurs.
