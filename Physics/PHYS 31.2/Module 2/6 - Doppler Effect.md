The Doppler effect occurs when the source (and/or observer) of a sound wave is in motion.

In analyzing the Doppler effect, one must consider the following:
- $v_L$: the velocity of the listener relative to the medium (air)
- $v_s$: the velocity of the source relative to the medium
- positive direction: from the listener to the source
- $v$: velocity of sound in air (always positive)

There will be two cases.

### Moving Listener, Stationary Source
When the listener moves with velocity $v_L$ towards stationary $S$, and $S$ emits a sound wave with frequency $f_s$ and wavelength $\lambda=v/f_s$, the frequency that the listener hears is
$$
f_L = \frac{v+v_L}{\lambda} = \frac{v+v_L}{v/f_s}
$$
which then gives us
$$
f_L = (\frac{v+v_L}{v})f_s = (1+\frac{v_L}{v})f_s 
$$
Note that this means that the observed frequency increases when moving towards the source, and decreases when moving away from the source.

### Moving Source, Moving Listener
When the listener moves with velocity $v_L$ towards $S$ moving away with velocity $v_s$, and $S$ emits a sound wave with frequency $f_s$, the wavelength $\lambda$ is no longer equal to $v/f_s$.

Note that given period $T = 1/f_s$, then the wave moves a distance of $vT = v/f_s$ and the source moves a distance of $v_sT = v_s/f_s$ at $t = T$.

The wavelength then differs behind and in front of the source.

#### In Front of Moving Source
$$
\lambda_\text{front} = \frac{v}{f_s} - \frac{v_s}{f_s} = \frac{v-v_s}{f_s}
$$
#### Behind Moving Source
$$
\lambda_\text{behind} = \frac{v+v_s}{f_s}
$$

We can then apply that to our original formula for the frequency heard by the listener:
$$
\begin{align}
f_L &= \frac{v+v_L}{\lambda} \\
&= \frac{v+v_L}{\lambda_\text{behind}} = \frac{v+v_l}{(v+v_s)/f_s} \\
f_L &= \frac{v+v_L}{v+v_s}f_s
\end{align}
$$
Note that this can be generalized for all situations. Also notice how the frequency gets higher as they move closer to each other, and it gets lower as they move farther from each other.

Essentially,
$f_L > f_s$ when $v_s < 0$; $f_L < f_s$ when $v_s > 0$.

### Double Doppler Shift

### Shock Waves & Sonic Booms
Typically, $v_s < v$. As such, the waves will be crowded together in front of a moving source. In other words, as $v_s \rightarrow v$, then $\lambda_\text{front} \rightarrow 0$.

Due to Newton's third law (a moving object exerts a large force on the air), there is a large increase in air resistance (aerodynamic drag) as $v_s \rightarrow v$ (this is called the "sound barrier").

Jet aircraft can approach speeds where this sound barrier is broken ($v_s > v$), achieving a supersonic velocity. As such, the aircraft can outrun the sound that they create, and a series of wave crests is emitted from its nose. Each crest spreads out in a circle.

At time $t$, the crest emitted at $S_1$ spreads out with a radius $vt$ but the aircraft travels a longer distance of $v_st$. The emitted crests interfere constructively along the blue line, the latter of which makes an angle $\alpha$ with a large amplitude wave crest along the line (the "shock wave"). This shockwave forms a 3-D cone.

This angle can be found through:
$$
\sin\alpha = \frac{vt}{v_st} = \frac{v}{v_s}
$$
The mach number of a supersonic object is the ratio between $v_s$ and $v$ (i.e. how fast the object is relative to the speed of sound).

### Summary
#### Doppler Effect
A generalization of the doppler effect formula is
$$
f_L = \frac{v \pm v_L}{v \pm v_s}f_s
$$
where the sign of $v_L$ and $v_s$ depends on the direction of the movement of the listener and source. When moving towards the other, then the velocity is a positive. If moving away from the other, then the velocity is a negative.

#### Shock Wave
The angle of the shock wave generated by a supersonic object is
$$
\sin\alpha = \frac{vt}{v_st} = \frac{v}{v_s}
$$
