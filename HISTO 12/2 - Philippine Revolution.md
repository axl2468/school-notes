## First Phase (1896-1897)
#### 1896 Revolution
Manila
- ill-defended
- most Spanish troops in Mindanao
- only 1 native infantry regiment
Bonifacio's military plan
- isolate Manila, take Intramuros
- failure: Blanco's defense of Manila, lack of support from Cavite
Blanco
- wavering between policy of aggression and policy of attraction
- lack of military force
	- only 3000 people!
Polavieja
- pursue Katipunan forces in Manila
- tighten blockade of Cavite

8 rays of the sun in the flag:
- 8 Provinces under martial law:
	- Manila
	- Cavite
	- Nueva

Tagalog or Philippine revolution?
- mainly Manila and Cavite
- Tagalog provinces with Tagalog leaders
- Katipunan: native land = Katagalugan
- Boni: "Ang Dapat Mabatid ng mga Tagalog"
- Aguinaldo: "Long live the Tagalogs!"
- Ileto: Tagalog pasyon, Bernardo Carpio (king of the Tagalogs)
- Blatant regionalism?
Responses from non-Tagalog provinces:
- apathy: Tagalog problem
- suspicion: removal of Spaniards = Tagalog tyranny
- Cebuano elite supported Spain
- Many provinces joined the revolution only in 1898
But:
- Tagalog = Filipino
- Cartilla: "The word Tagalog refers to all those born in this archipelago"
- Ronquillo: Tagalog = Filipino nation
- Mabini: The country is formed by all the provinces
Why Tagalog and not Filipino?
- "Filipino" - strange term to ordinary people
- "Tagalog" - more familiar term, more indigenous term?
2 Katipunan councils in Cavite
- Magdiwang: Mariano Alvarez (council of Bonifacio's wife's uncle)
- Magdalo: Baldomero Aguinaldo
- revolutionary councils -> rival factions
- Geography:
	- Magdalo towns were more vulnerable, closer to Manila
	- Magdiwang refused to give support
Bonifacio's visit to Cavite
- December 1896
- Invitation from Alvarez
- Evaluation of state of affairs in Cavite
- Intervention in Magdiwang-Magdalo conflict
Tejeros Convention
- consolidate Cavite's defense
- what kind of govt: old Katipunan or new govt
- Magdiwang-Magdalo factionalism
- Why did Bonifacio lose the presidential election?
- Magdiwang members > Magdalo members
- Results:
	- Aguinaldo (President)
	- Trias (Vice President)
	- Ricarte (Captain general)
	- Riego de Dios (Director of War)
	- Bonifacio (Director of Interior)
	- All Magdiwang except for Aguinaldo
- Not actually a story of Magdalo vs Magdiwang!
	- Magdiwangs sided with Magdalo (Aguinaldo)
