### Image of Empire
- Basketweaving

### Industrial Education
- Development of work ethic (especially among "backwards races")
- Fred Atkinson: "We must beware the possibility of overdoing the matter of higher education and unfitting the Filipino for practical work. We should heed the lesson taught us in our reconstruction period when we started to educate the negro. The education of the masses here must be an agricultural and industrial one."
- Commercialization and Standardization
- Future: Farmers and tradesmen
- Atkinson: "The nature of the tribes makes especially important the instruction among industrial and agricultural lines, rather than along the lines of ordinary primary instruction."
