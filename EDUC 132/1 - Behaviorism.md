### What is Learning?
Textbook definition:
- a relatively permanent change in behavior due to experience
	- behaviorism
- the active mental process of acquiring, remembering, and using knowledge
- the product of the interplay of personal, behavioral, and environmental influences
- active and personal construction of knowledge

### Classical Conditioning
- process of repeatedly associating a previously neutral stimulus (NS) with an unconditioned stimulus (UCS) in order to evoke a conditioned response (CR)
### Operant Conditioning
- form of learning in which the consequences of behavior produce changes in the probability that the behavior will occur
- reward & punishment (positive & negative reinforcement)
##### Positive reinforcement
- reinforcement such that the behavior will occur again
###### Negative reinforcement
- reinforcement such that the behavior will NOT occur again
###### Punishment
- negative consequence, same outcome as negative reinforcement

### Strengthening desirable behaviors
1. Choose effective reinforcers
2. Make reinforcers contingent and timely
	- Only demonstrate reward (immediately) when the desired behavior is shown
3. Select the best schedule of reinforcement
	- To shape the behavior, reward should be immediate
	- To strengthen, one can do intermittent scheduling
4. Consider contracting
5. Use prompts and shaping
	-  Reminders of expected behavior
		- Eventually, you will no longer need this
	- Shaping
		- Use small, achievable behaviors to shape it into a bigger one

### Decreasing Undesirable Behavior
1. Use differential enforcement
	- Strengthening the opposite behavior when spotted
2. Terminate reinforcement (extinction)
	- Useful when the motive is attention-seeking
		- Planned ignoring
	- Extinction burst may happen at the start (the undesirable behavior increases in frequency)
3. Remove desirable stimuli
4. Present aversive stimuli (punishment)
	- The consequence should NOT cause physical, mental, or emotional harm
