### What is Learning?
Textbook definition:
- a relatively permanent change in behavior due to experience
	- behaviorism
- the active mental process of acquiring, remembering, and using knowledge
- the product of the interplay of personal, behavioral, and environmental influences
- active and personal construction of knowledge

### Classical Conditioning
- process of repeatedly associating a previously neutral stimulus (NS) with an unconditioned stimulus (UCS) in order to evoke a conditioned response (CR)
### Operant Conditioning
- form of learning in which the consequences of behavior produce changes in the probability that the behavior will occur
- reward & punishment (positive & negative reinforcement)
Positive reinforcement
- reinforcement such that the behavior will occur again
Negative reinforcement
- reinforcement such that the behavior will NOT occur again
Punishment
- negative consequence, same outcome as negative reinforcement
