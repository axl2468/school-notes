### Boundary Conditions
A wave on a string reflects depending on the state of the end of the string:
- If it is a fixed end, inverted reflection occurs.
- If it is a free end, a non-inverted reflection occurs.


### Wave Interference and Superposition
When waves overlap, the resulting final displacement is the algebraic sum of each individual pulse.
#### Principle of Superposition
If we have two waves of position $y_1$ and $y_2$, then our final displacement is
$$
y(x,t) = y_1(x,t) + y_2(x,t)
$$

### Standing Waves on a String
Consider when a sinusoidal wave is reflected on a fixed end.

The resulting wave is called a **standing wave**. This is because the wave "appears" to be non-moving (aka "standing" in place). There are two parts of a standing wave:
- Nodes: points on a wave where the displacement is always 0
- Antinodes: points on a wave where displacement reaches its maximum

For a standing wave to manifest, the length of the string $L$ and the wavelength $\lambda$ should have the following relationship:
$$
L = \frac{n}{2}\lambda_n
$$
where $n$ is any integer, corresponding to the number of nodes present in the standing wave.
