### Normal Modes
There are two common cases for standing sound waves:
1. Standing sound waves in an open pipe (open on both ends)
2. Standing sound waves in a stopped pipe (open on one end, closed on another)

Remember that $f_n = n\frac{v}{2L}$ for a string fixed at both ends. For both cases:
1. Open pipe:
$$
	\begin{align}
	f_n = n\frac{v}{2L} \tag{n = 1, 2, 3, ...}
	\end{align}
$$
2. Stopped pipe:
$$
	\begin{align}
	f_n = n\frac{v}{4L} \tag{n = 1, 3, 5, ...}
	\end{align}
$$
Note that this also implies that for a stopped pipe, $f_1 = \frac{v}{4L}$.
### Resonance
This occurs when an object with a natural frequency receives a forced vibration (forced oscillation) at the same frequency (i.e. resonance frequency).

This causes the vibrations in the object to increase in amplitude (i.e. increase in energy).

In a sound pipe, a resonance curve pattern can be seen where peaks occur at the normal-mode frequencies.
