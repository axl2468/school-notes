How to sum up infinitely many terms
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_n = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \text{...}
$$
We can break them down into sequences of partial sums:
$$
\begin{align*}
S_1 &= a_1 \\
S_2 &= a_1 + a_2 \\
S_3 &= a_1 + a_2 + a_3 \\
S_n &= a_1 + a_2 + \text{...} + a_n \\
S_{n+1} &= \text{...}
\end{align*}
$$
