The operations on arithmetic numbers are intuitive in nature.
### Addition
$$(2+3i) + (-1+2i) = (2-1) + (3i+2i) = 1+5i$$
### Subtraction
$$(2+3i) - (-1+2i) = 3+i$$
### Multiplication
$$(2+3i)(-1+2i) = -2+4i-3i-6 = -8+i$$
### Division
Similar to [[Rationalizing the Denominator|rationalizing the denominator]] for fractions involving radicals, we can multiply both numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the latter.
$$\frac{2+3i}{-1+2i} = \frac{(2+3i)(-1-2i)}{(-1+2i)(-1-2i)} = \frac{-2-7i+6}{1+4}$$
$$= \frac{4-7i}{5} = \frac{4}{5} - \frac{7}{5}i$$
