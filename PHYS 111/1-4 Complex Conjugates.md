Notation for conjugates:
$$
z*=\bar{z}=x-iy
$$
Note that
$$
Re(z) = Re(z*), \,\,\, Im(z)=-Im(z)
$$
Because of this, a complex conjugate (on the plane) is a reflection of the original complex number along the x-axis.

Because of the stated properties of the real and imaginary parts, if $z$ is real, then $z*=z$.
