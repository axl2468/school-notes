The operations on arithmetic numbers are intuitive in nature.
### Addition
$$
\begin{align}
(2+3i) + (-1+2i) &= (2-1) + (3i+2i) \\ 
&= 1+5i
\end{align}
$$
### Subtraction
$$
(2+3i) - (-1+2i) = 3+i
$$
### Multiplication
$$
\begin{align}
(2+3i)(-1+2i) &= -2+4i-3i-6 \\
&= -8+i
\end{align}
$$
### Division
Similar to [[Rationalizing the Denominator|rationalizing the denominator]] for fractions involving radicals, we can multiply both numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the latter.
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{2+3i}{-1+2i} &= \frac{(2+3i)(-1-2i)}{(-1+2i)(-1-2i)} \\
&= \frac{-2-7i+6}{1+4} \\
&= \frac{4-7i}{5} \\ 
&= \frac{4}{5} - \frac{7}{5}i
\end{align}
$$
