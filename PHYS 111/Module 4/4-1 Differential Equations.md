Differential equations (DEs) are equations relating a function and its derivatives.

### Types of DEs
1. Ordinary (ODE)
	- Function depends on one variable only
	- Example:
	$$
	\frac{dx}{dt}+5x = \cos2t
	$$
2. Partial (PDE)
	- This depends on two or more independent variables.
	- Can be expressed like $y(x,t)$.
	- Example:
$$
	\frac{\delta^2y}{\delta x^2} = \frac{1}{v^2} \frac{\delta^2y}{\delta t^2}
$$

We will be considering first order ordinary derivatives (FOODEs).
