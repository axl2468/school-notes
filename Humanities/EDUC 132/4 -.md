### Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development
Linear model of cognitive development
#### Schema
- child seeks to construct an understanding of the world, the developing brain creates schemas
- actions or mental representations that organize knowledge
- patterns of behavior or thinking: to find out about the world and act in the world
#### Equilibration
- people are intrinsically motivated to understand the world
- process of storing balance between present understanding and new experiences
- drive for order

#### Adaptation
Process of adjusting the schema to one's experiences to maintain equilibrium
- Accommodation
	- existing schemas may be altered, or new ones formed as a person learns new info
	- disrupts the structure of pre-existing schemas
- Assimilation
	- new information becomes incorporated into pre-existing schemas
	- info itself does not change the schema, schema already accounts for new info
	- promotes status quo of cognitive structures
