### Stage 1 ()

### Stage 2 (Naive Hedonism)
- Children in this stage do what is "right" based on what is pleasurable (i.e. what is "rewarding").
- Examples include:
	- Cheating
		- They may cheat because getting high grades is a reward
		- Or they may avid cheating because they don't want the consequences of getting caught.
	- Sharing Toys
		- They may share toys because they are expecting to get something in return
		- Or because they don't want to be punished by an adult.

	- FOMO
	- Parental approval

### Stage 4 (Conforms to Avoid Censure by Authorities)
