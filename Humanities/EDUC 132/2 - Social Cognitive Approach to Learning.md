### Reciprocal Determinism Theory
- Reciprocal Determinism Model
- Three different factors:
	- Personal Factors
	- Environmental Factors
	- Behavior
- These interact with each other in the process of learning
"Individuals are neither powerless objects controlled by environmental forces nor entirely free agents who can do whatever they choose." - Albert Bandura

### Observational Learning
Attention
- Extend to which we focus on others' behavior
- Observing target skill
Retention
- Our ability to retain a representation of others' behavior in memory
- Remembering
Production Processes
- Our ability to actually perform the actions we observe
- Execution
Motivation
- Our need for the actions we witness: their usefulness to us
- e.g. Verbal praise, snacks
#### Outcomes
- directing attention
- fine-tuning already-learned behaviors
- strengthening or weakening of inhibitions
- teaching new behaviors
