### Reciprocal Determinism Theory
- Reciprocal Determinism Model
- Three different factors:
	- Personal Factors
	- Environmental Factors
	- Behavior
- These interact with each other in the process of learning
"Individuals are neither powerless objects controlled by environmental forces nor entirely free agents who can do whatever they choose." - Albert Bandura

### Observational Learning
Attention
- Extend to which we focus on others' behavior
- Observing target skill
Retention
- Our ability to retain a representation of others' behavior in memory
- Remembering
Production Processes
- Our ability to actually perform the actions we observe
- Execution
Motivation
- Our need for the actions we witness: their usefulness to us
- e.g. Verbal praise, snacks
#### Outcomes
- directing attention
- fine-tuning already-learned behaviors
- strengthening or weakening of inhibitions
- teaching new behaviors

### Cognitive Perspective to Learning
#### Information Procssing Model
Three partitions of memories:
- Sensory Memory
	- Capacity unlimited
	- Shortest duration
- Short-Term Memory
	- Capacity limited
	- Short duration
- Long-Term Memory

Three memory processes:
- Encoding
- Storing
- Retrieval

### Methods of Encoding
- Rehearsal
	- activation or recycling of information through memory
		- maintenance: holds information long enough or it to be acted upon
		- elaborative: relates the information to concepts already in the long-term memory
- Imagery:
	- constructing a visual image about an item or term to be learned
- Chunking
	- combining pieces of information together to allow them to take less space in the working memory
	- "Chunks" - number of items that the short term memory can hold at any time
- Mnemonics
	- Memory-assisting technique that links new and unfamiliar information with already-learned information
#### Short Term Memory
- Limited capacity, $7 \pm 2$

### Long Term Memory
- the component of memory in which large amounts of information can be stored for long periods of time
- "permanent" memory never forget the information; lose the capacity to find information in the long-term memory
- information are organized and interconnected in some ways

Types of Long-Term Memory
- Semantic memory
	- Stores facts and general knowledge
	- Organized in networks of interconnected ideas or relationship called schemata
	- memory of knowing
	- Implications: learning and teaching
		- Prior knowledge: make sure that the students have appropriate schema to learn the new material
		- Meaningful learning: real-life application
		- Create memorable events involvin visual or auditory images to improve retention of concepts and information
		- Use of multimedia to illustrate text/complex ideas
