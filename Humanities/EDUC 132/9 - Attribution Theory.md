They refer to explanations people tend to make to explain success or failure. Perceptions of success or failure will determine the amount of effort the person will expend on that activity in the future.
 
### Three dimensions
#### Locus
- sources of cause
- internal: self as origin of cause
	- e.g. I passed the oral exam because I prepared well
- external: environment as origin of cause
	- e.g. I passed the oral exam because the questions were easy
#### Stability
- stable: outcome is likely to be the same if the behavior is performed on another occasion
	- e.g. I passed the oral exam because I usually do better in performance assessments
- unstable: the outcome is likely to be different on another occasion
	- e.g. I passed the oral exam because I had enough sleep the night before
#### Controllability
- controllable: outcome is able to controlled by the person
	- e.g. I passed the oral exam because I prepared well
- uncontrollable: outcome is not able to be controlled by the person
	- e.g. I did not pass the oral exam because the questions were very difficult

### Factors
Four factors were identified to have an influence on attributions:
- ability (internal, stable, uncontrollable)
- effort (internal, unstable, controllable)
- task difficulty (external, stable, uncontrollable)
- luck (external, unstable, uncontrollable)
