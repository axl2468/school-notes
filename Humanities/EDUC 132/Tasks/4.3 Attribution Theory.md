 Read the following cases and think about what the teacher can say to each of the following students to maximize motivation to work harder in the future. 
1. Helen got an A in history, and she thinks this is because she has always enjoyed and been good at history.
2. Pete got an F in history. He thinks this is because the teacher asked a bunch of questions that were unreasonable and unexpected.
3. Chris got an A in history. He thinks this is because he studied hard and the teacher asked questions based on exactly what he studied.
4. Maria got a C in history. She would like to do better, but she says it is too hard.
5. Henry got a C in history. He says he could have done better if he could have found a way to organize the information better.

Re-visit the cases above. Choose **ONE** case. 

1. Identify the factor (ability, task difficulty, effort, or luck) to which each learner attributes success or failure.
2. State whether this factor is internal/external, stable/unstable, and controllable/uncontrollable.
3. Describe the impact on the learner's motivation. 
4.  What would you say to the student based on what you know about the attribution theory (you may reiterate what you posted or modify)?

Answer:
I chose Case 3 (Chris). Chris attributes his success to two factors: effort (as he noted that he studied hard for the class) and luck (as the teacher asked questions based exactly on what he studied, implying an element of luck).

Interestingly, these two factors are almost the opposite of each other, with the effort being internal and controllable (only Chris has full control of both of these factors). Meanwhile, luck is external and uncontrollable (as Chris cannot control whether or not the teacher will give questions based on what he studied). They are only similar in the aspect of being unstable, as the existence of these factors can change in the future (especially with luck).

Applying the Attribution Theory, the impact of the factors on a learner's motivation would depend if the student has high self-esteem (and a high achiever) or a low self-esteem (or a low achiever). For example, a positive luck in Chris' situation may have a negative effect on someone with low self-esteem, as they will only attribute their success to purely luck. However, Chris also attributing his success to his studying habits demonstrates that he has a high self-esteem, and that luck would not have such a negative impact on his motivation (as he may see this as simply an extra bonus that contributed to his success).

If I were to say something to Chris, I would reinforce his belief that his success is attributed to his effort, as this would further increase his self-esteem and motivation to continue with his behavior (as I mentioned in the last paragraph). I would also try to remind him that while nice, he should not focus too much on his luck (with his teacher giving him the desired questions) as it is external, unstable, completely out of his control, and most likely was just a minor factor to his success—hopefully, this is enough to let him continue with his current good behavior of applying high effort to his schoolwork.
