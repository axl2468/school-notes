**Why contest and disrupt language? (In the thrust of Jacques Derrida's deconstruction and différance, we learned that meanings can never be elaborately expressed—this is already hard to stomach, so why add insult to injury?) Is it to demonstrate how imagination can stretch and prove itself in writing? Is it to engage existing readers and make readers out of the illiterate by reworking the work to a palatable taste? (If so, are we not only deceiving ourselves because intertextuality at times deliberately misses legibility?) Why horse around when the writer is perfectly able to unload the story in one uncomplicated swoop? Why must there be numbered lists that do not reveal anything? (Is it because an affinity for the experimental is the latest wrinkle? Well, "artistic autonomy!" Well, "Out with the boring, in with the not-so-boring!" Well, "Shut the fuck up! Shit is seductive! It is what it is!" Then, how frivolous.) Why must the writer convoke other writers, academics, philosophers, and thinkers—by mentioning them, involving them in whatever drama and dirt—and have them used for the interiorization and crystallization of those the writer ought to be resolving by themself in the first place? Why, above all, wear out the "I" persona or the first person point of view, only for the writer to exercise their uninfluenced voice so tacitly, often in turns and in tatters?**
