- blue man, paralyzed friend, the obsession with blue
-  numbering - like a bible verse?!?!??!

- reminds me of a stoner friend i had

- trance, flowed in such a bizarre but enjoyable way

- vibes of someone with ADHD browsing through wikipedia and following random hyperlinks
	- disjointed, fragmented, information overload
	- sir harvey

- unapologetically horny
andy warhol - blue movie
140 - tribe of men, cardboard box
62
179
- carnal desires

- a lot of the stuff went out of my head - i felt it but it was so overwhelming that i did not get to absorb everything. if the goal was to teach about something, she's doing a shit job at it

did i learn anything new? barely. did i regret reading it? no. it was pleasurable regardless.
