	- attract investors
- funding
	- partly from government, partly from subscriptions to publications for voting

- American exceptionalism

### Frivolous pageants
- Each side (Americans and Filipinos) used it for their own nationalistic purposes
	- Rallying point for Filipinas for a sense of national identity
- Pura Villanueva
- unequal treatment
- Filipino critique: "To elect a foreigner would tacitly admit the absolute lack of Filipina women capable of carrying off such a position with distinction"
- Filipino press praised Villanueva and called Colton ordinary
- Voting a patriotic duty
	- "If she can occupy the throne of a Carnival, she can also that of a nation."
- 1912: Separate titles for Filipino, American, Spanish
- Filipino Day and Night
	- "while the American and Spanish day will be presided over by queens, the Filipinos will have an express at the end of their festival, and the Empress will be assisted by three kings and three queens"

### Public Reaction
- Initial reaction:
	- Pageants vs Filipino elite gender norms
	- like prostitutes

		- for elite Filipinas
	- expensive accessories

- having individual achievements:
	- education in prestigious colleges
		- college education = modern citizen
		- Villanueva (1934) "In the early 1900s, women did not have to be educated to the same extent as today... Women went to school for a while, got married eventually, and thereafter retired more or less into inconspicuousness.. Any woman who had more education than the average member for her sex was bound to become outstanding"
		- intellectual abilities:
			- sign of class and social status

- debates on traditional vs modern Filipina
	- Maria Clara vs modern coed

### Why Participate?
- Celebrity status
- Graphic: "As carnival queen, she has become a celebrity. Carnival queens are perhaps the first of female celebrities in the Philippines. She has a public, a large amount of people who admire her, who can look at her (because of the pictures) and who are her fans."
- Marriage prospects
- Villanueva: journalist before becoming Manila Carnival queen, later married Teodoro Kalaw
- beauty queens: symbols of respectability

### Beauty pageants

- from Filipino critique to popularity
- modern Filipina woman

## Educated Filipinas
### Maria Clara
- 1934 Constitutional Convention
	- should Filipinas have the right to vote?
	- debate framed around Maria Clara
- "The opponents of woman suffrage predicate their opposition on the assumption that our women of today are the Maria Claras of yesterday. That is a false premise, that is false assumption. The Maria Claras or the Maria Clara type is gone. I would be ashamed, Mr. President, of our women today if they were still the Maria Claras of yesterday-women who lived in seclusion, frail and fragile, taken care of. It is an insult to progress and civilization if we claim that our women today are of a bygone era."
### Femininity
- Spanish colonial period:
	- religious, charitable, demure
	- Maria Clara
	- rudimentary education
	- domesticity and motherhood
	- "Politics was not the realm of women"
- American colonial period:
	- English-speaking
	- University educated
	- Professional
	- American governors-general: pro-suffrage
### Opposition
- whether women should enter all aspects of public space
- civic work, but not politics
- too "Americanized"
- Teodora Kalaw: "unconscious victims of modernity"
	- "walking out alone" with "a handbag under the arm, just like like bold little American misses
### Amorsolo

- Civic organizations:
	- Asociacion Feminista Filipina
- 1933 Women's Suffrage Bill
- 1934 Constitutional Convention
- 1935 Constitution:
	- Philippine Independence
	- but no women's suffrage
- 1937 plebiscite

### Women's Definition of Womanhood

- beauty queen

### Colonial Mentality?
- suffragist = American colonial influence?
- education and clubs
- from one colonial construction to another: from Maria Clara to suffragist?
