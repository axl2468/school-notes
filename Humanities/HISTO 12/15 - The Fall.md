### Economy
- centralized regime: opportunity for both reform and corruption
- export boom + external borrowing = high GNP
- high sugarcane and coconut oil prices
- debt increases throughout the years
- decline from 1981: debt crisis
- 1983 political turmoil, Ninoy's assassination
- 1984 & 1985 economic crash: worst recession
#### Causes of the decline
- unfortunate circumstances: high US interest rates, collapse of world sugar prices
- weak economy: massive debt, protectionism
- crony capitalism

### Crony Capitalism
- family with government positions
- friends with economic monopoly
- Lopezes: $400 million fortune (Manila Chronicle, ABS-CBN, sugar industry)
- Roberto Benedicto took over Lopez fortune
- Eduardo Cojuangco
	- used coconut levy to buy San Miguel
	- UCPB controlled 80% of coconut milling
- sugar and coconut oil: buy at low price from local producers, sell at high price at world market
- Herminio Disini: nuclear power plant, toacco industry
- Rodolfo Cuenca: govt construction contracts, exclusive right to ship cargo to US
- Ricardo Silverio: automobile parts industry
- strengthened family's and friends' economic power
- weakened independent economic groups
- when these industries failed -> rescued by government
- crony capitalism was the main reason for bankruptcy of state financial institutions
- Cesar Virata: "We were quite liberal in guaranteeing loans... We found out later that their motives were not as pure as we would have liked. In other words, some of the companies really wanted to make money out of purchase of equipment rather than by operating it. This has been one of the major faults in our system."
### Social Debacle
- highest inflation ever
- spike in poverty
- urban discontent
- suppressed political opposition->radicalization
	- Marcos was the biggest recruiter of the NPA
### Political Forces
- Muslim nationalism, MNLF
	- Land was taken by the migration of the Huks
- MNLF: "free ourselves from the terror, oppression, and tyraanny of Filipino colonialism which has caused us untold sufferings and misteries by criminally usurping our land"
- CPP
- Catholic church
- social democrats
- reactionaries

### Marcos' institutional allies
- technocrats
	- though they would separate from him in the latter years
- military

robust government institutions:
- rules -> marcos broke the rules through favouritism
- impersonal organizations -> the businesses were controlled by the government and cronies
- control over military -> politicized the military, military became involved in politics
### Ninoy
- 1983 assassination -> public demonstrations
- authoritarian rule + economic crisis
- leadership vacuum among opposition
- Typical interpretation: typical political oligarch -> "changed"
### Philippine history
- like a medieval drama
- different interpretations
- Rizal: ilustrado vs healer
- Independence: Quezon vs Ricarte
- sentimental and religious > political
### Ninoy (cont.)
- "It's time to be home with our people and suffer with them. And if you'll remember, when I left home, I promised to return. I'll be keeping that promise. I would rather die a glorious death than be killed by a Boston taxicab."
- "I have no doubt Rizal would have been the first to be picked up were he alive today and maybe, re-enact his martyrdom at Bagumbayan"
- return-risk sacrifice
- folk heroes, Christ, Rizal, Ninoy
- Ileto: "The question is not what really happened, or who the culprit really was, but that a familiar drama involving familiar themes is being reenacted."
