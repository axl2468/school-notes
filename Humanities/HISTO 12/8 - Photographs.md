### Photography
- scientific documentation
- Barrows: "Frequently in the same tribe there will be found to be more than one type. Do not try to average the characteristics of these, but describe each type separately and with care, and notice if the different types occupy any different social position, or appear to differ in intelligence."
### Racial hierarchy
- races: Negrito < Indonesian < Malaysian
- Barrows: "We have tribes representing the whole scale of culture from savagery to civilization."
### Worcester
- "The only thing that kept me in the Philippine service for so long a time was my interest in the work for the non-Christian tribes."
- PT Barnum of non-Christian tribes
- photographs to justify US colonial rule
- annual reports
### Clothing
- Kalinga leaders
- coat vs nudity
- naked vs clothed
- savage vs civilized
- racial dichotomy
- Ibag the Negrito = Filipino of Yesteryear
- Worcester: "There were some thirty Negritos, all of whom were very much dressed up for the occasion. Most of the men had old hats and cast-off European clothes."
- not naked!
- unpublished, contrasted with the idea of the non-Christian tribes being "backwards"
- Worcester forced the tribespeople to wear their "traditional clothing"
### Undressing
- female Negritos
- Tagalog women
- wealthy Kalinga woman in elaborate clothing
- Bontoc women
### Manipulation
- 1913 National Geographic
- "Kalinga Police"
- "The wild men who join the police in the Philippines do not immediately develop into the smart soldierly troops shown of pages 1222 and 1224. The Lubuagan police of Kalinga, for instance, wear their ordinary but scanty costume, merely attaching a police badge to their gee-strings."
- In the 1911 Nat Geo publication, the picture of Kalinga men were depicted as dancers. In the 1913 Nat Geo publication, the same photo depicted them as police.
