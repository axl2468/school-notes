### Huk Rebellion
- most important and largest peasant revolt
- Central Luzon: Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, Tarlac
- 1930s: discontent
- 1946 to early 1950s: rebellion
- Kerkvliet: perspective of participants

- barrio of San Ricardo (Talavera, Nueva Ecija)
- main cause of rebellion
	- peasants wanted to return to how peasant-landlord relations were before
	- mistreated
- peasants' relationship with Manuel Tinio
	- nostalgia
### Tenancy
- American perspective: tenancy is bad, in debt
- Tenant perspective: good, beneficial
	- tenants = personal following, political power
	- hacenderos = benefactors, protectors
- when did the relationship change?
	- Manolo Tinio took over
	- no more paternal relationship, more business-minded
	- no more rasyon (interest-less loans) system
- deterioration of traditional ties between local elits and peasants
- paternalism = form of insurance
- hard work, bare subsistence
- similar situation throughout Central Luzon
### Causes of the Changes
- "progress"
	- population growth
	- capitalism: cash crops
	- land > labor
	- expansion of central government
- Why Central Luzon mainly?
	- Geography, plains
	- Distance from Manila
### Rebellion
- justified protests and rebellion
- violent response from officials and elites
- uneasy alliance between local peasants and PKP (Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas)
### Peasant Demands
- moderate demands
- reform the tenancy system
- =/= legal title to land
- return of traditional obligations
- =/= overthrow the government
- right to subsistence living
- why so little demands:
	- peasants wanted to maximize security, minimize risk
### Peasant Response
- explored every possible avenue: move to other haciendas, work in cities, find more traditional landowners, buy own land, etc.
- discontent: strikes, petitions, lobbying, collective action
- last resort: rebellion
- not an irrational response, clear gradual degradation
### Rebellion
- 1945-1946 (Japanese occupation): repression from government and agrarian elites -> peasant violence
- private armies
- persecution of Democratic Alliance (political party) and Pambansang Kaisahang ng mga Magbubukid (peasants union)
### Huk Officials
- Luis Taruc:
	- son of tenant farmer high school graduate, tailor, commander of Hukbalahap, member of PKP and Democratic Alliance, Supreme commander of Huks
- William Pomeroy:
	- American communist party member, HMB official
- Mariano Balgos (aka Comrade Bakal):
	- typesetter, leader of printers' union, guerrilla fighter, top leader in PKP
### Leadership
- local: villagers, moderate goals (return of patron-client ties, end of repression)
- national: urban professionals, e.g. PKP officers
	- radical goals (overthrow the government, redistribute land, etc.)
- middle: bridge between local organizations and national leadership
- uneasy alliance between PKP and peasants
### Huk Rebellion: success or failure?
- limited reprieves, but decline of old order (which is then failure for the local peasants)
- benefits: rent reduction, more respectful landlords, lower interest rates, peasant organizations
- former Huk: "Even if we got nothing, that's not important. What's important is that we had to fight back. And we fought so well that the big people and the government will never forget us again."
