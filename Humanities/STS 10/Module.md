# Intro
### Why should we "believe" in Science?
- People who don't understand science reduce it to a matter of perspective
- Many trust science blindly
- The value of Science lies in it being a product of consensus
- The stability of today's society: honesty and integrity in the practice of science
- Technology as a tangible impact of science

# Technology and the Rise of Civilizations
We have coevolved with Technology.

The development of any society is dependent on the Technology it possesses and utilizes

### Science? Technology?
mutually independent, yet ironically, obligate dancers dancing to the same music (Rip, 1992).

The loop:
Science -> Knowledge -> Technology -> Tools (and repeat)

### Ancient Science or Ancient Technology?
- Non-formulated, fluid, dynamic: observation, explanation, prediction, experimentation (Godfrey-Smith, 2003)
- Observations formed "common senses": predictive power of verifiable observations
- Hinging on survival: response to environmental changes
### Ancient Technology
##### Making Tools
One of our first cultural adaptations expanded our diets. With better nourishments, we could develop bigger, more complex brains.
##### Master of Fire
With fire, we could cook food and vary our diet, defend against predators, and socialize more --- which may have refined language.
##### Bigger Brains
As we gathered into larger social groups, bigger brains developed along with more complex communication and problem-solving.
##### Domestication
Animal and plant domestication, probably spreading hand in hand, led to permanent settlements and later to cities and civilizations.

Using technology preceded understanding the science behind it:
Early humans -> Landscape alteration -> early settlements

### Defining Moment: Technological Pressure
- Human survival was differentiated by he pressure to develop better technology to aid in survival
- Better technological development transformed humanity as a species
- Technology defined drastic changes in human civilizations over the last three centuries.

Shall we go beyond "biological deficits?"

### Early Human Development
1. Dependent on the environment and technological development (Nolan and Lenski, 2006)
2. Knowledge development of bountiful land, beneficial flora and fauna, useful tools
3. Later, gradual shit from sustenance in mobility to sedentary subsistence strategies

### Social Emergence
- Rise of crop complexes over millenia
	- Identification of suitable crops and domesticable animals
	- Practice over vast tracts of land
	- Led to food surplus and animal husbandry
- Population increase and job diversification
	- Decrease in population pressure, increase in resources
	- Not all became farmers--others focused on animals, some on toolmaking, others on shelter

### Sedentism & Agriculture
First technological wave

Early human civilizations
- Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, Indian subcontinent
- Freshwater sources: crucial for agricultural shift

Focus on food production
- Technologies developed were geared towards this action
- Environment was altered to cater to enhanced food yields
### Continuing Societal Emergence
- Cooperative and competitive actions
	- Exchange of surplus goods leading to trade
	- Conquest and invasion of other communities over coveted goods
	- Rise of military forces
- Formation of social hierarchy
	- Rise of landowner class
	- Expendable labor from lower classes
