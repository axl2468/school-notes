### Technology and Social Development in the Philippines
- Western, but imposed
	- Spanish technology and knowledge base
	- American public school system
- Fate of most Philippine indigenous knowledge and practices
	- Removed due to colonizer influence
	- Preserved in several indigenous groups
	- Syncretized in local practice
- Mismatch between expertise and development goals
	- Spanish goals: colonial agriculture, trade entrepot
	- American goals: industrial development
### Precolonial Science and Technology
- Use of stones in making weapons, sawing, and drilling
- Rice cultivation and boat building
- Own writing system, weights, and measures 
### Science and Technology during the Spanish Regime
- Ateneo de Manila University (1859)
- University of Santo Tomas Schools of Medicine and Pharmacy (1871)
- Manila Observatory (1865)
### Development of S&T during the American Regime
- Extensive public education system
- Scholarships for higher education in science and engineering
- Establishment of science research agencies and professional organizations
- Implementation of science-based public services
- Lack of coordination between science and education policies, and economic policies -> delayed industrialization of the Philippines, underdevelopment of the physical sciences/industrial research
### Science and Technology since Independence
- Education and training of scientists and engineers, and government support for scientific research and development remained unchanged
- Private colleges and universities provided education for the majority of the college population
- Lack of support, planning, and coordination for scientific work in government (low budget for research and low salaries of scientists)
- Bureau of Science (1905) -> Institute of Science (1941) -> Institute of Science and Technology (1951) -> National Science Development Board National Institute of Science and Technology (1958) -> National Science and Technology Authority (1982) -> DOST (1986)
