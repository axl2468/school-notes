# The Value of Science
### The Pillars of Science "Orthodoxy"
1. Science must assume that things in the universe are real.
2. The universe contains an order that can be perceived by the senses we possess.
3. Science presupposes that the principles that allow natural process to happen are the same principles that can be used to explain consistently, through careful study, whichever phenomena is being examined.
4. The explanation and prediction of any branch of Science must be logical and based on evidence.
5. Any scientific explanation is limited and robabilistic.
6. Science is not performed in isolation - it is a universal social endeavor.
7. The goal of science is to contribute meaningfully to the world.

### Some Characteristics of Science
- Science deals with **phenomena**, and must make assumptions to further comprehension.
	- Key ideas: Pillars 1 to 5, approximation, reductionism
- Science uses **no strict method** and draws from many disciplines
	- Key ideas: scientific methods, creative flexibility, interdisciplinarity in problem solving
- Science can lead to the development of technology.
	- Key ideas: application and articulation of Science, tools expand the reach of Science, human comfort
- Despite its reach and breadth, science has limits.
	- Key ideas: what can science describe? informed decisions, descriptive vs prescriptive
- Science involves taking risks and serendipity
	- Key ideas: never complete "luck", looking at "failure", using a different perspective
- Science is not static; it is contingent more than absolute.
	- Key ideas: self-correction, pseudoscience, furthers research
- Science is an inclusive, collaborative social exercise
	- Key ideas: big problems, big solutions; who are the stakeholders?; citizen science

### Louis Pasteur (1822-1895)
Scientific Over Traditional Mindset
- Before Pasteur, so many women died in childbirth (infection)
- The dirty doctors were more attractive
- Prevalence of black death, plague due to smallpox, deaths from
- Life expectancy due to a lot of younger people dying (maternal fatality)
- Pasteur changed that
For over 2000 years, traditional authority said that disease was caused by miasma/bad air caused by rotting matter.
Malaria -> bad air

#### Germ Theory
- Pasteur said that disease is caused by agents too small to be seen (microbes)
- Others have thought of this before, but they didnt persist. Pasteur did, and he verified the germ theory of disease.
- The germ theory was initially controversial, because he was a chemist and not a doctor.
- It led to the development of handwashing, sterilization, antiseptics, and changed healthcare forever.
#### Vaccination
- Pasteurs new ideas about infection led him to study chicken cholera.
- After a vacation away from his lab, Pasteur injected an old culture of bacteria into the chickens.
- The birds became sick but did not die as expected.
- When he injected them with fresh cholera injections, they were okay.
- Vaccination was discovered: weakened strains could give immunity.
#### Anthrax
- Anthrax was fatal to humans, and could wipe out entire populations of farm animals.
- Robert Koch, a German doctor, already found the bacteria.
- Pasteur discovered the vaccine and immunized 31 animals.
- Lesson: Science progresses by scientists building on the work of others.
#### Science Communication: Demonstration of Vaccination
- May 1881, Pasteur performed a public experiment at Pouilly-le-Fort
- Prepared two groups of 25 sheep, one goat, several cows
- The animals of one group were twice injected, with interval of 15 days
- All animals in non-vaccinated group died, while all the animals in the vaccinated group survived.
- It is very important to have the general public understand and accept vaccination, even today.
#### Chance Favors the Prepared Mind
- Did you ever observe to whom the accident happen? Chance favors only the prepared mind. - Louis Pasteur
#### Rabies Vaccine
- Pasteur produced the first rabies vaccine by growing virus in rabbits then weakening it by drying the affected nerve tissue
- Tested in 50 dogs before first human trial
- First used on 9-year-old Joseph Meister on July 6, 1885 after getting mauled by a rabid dog
- Done at some personal risk, and Pasteur could've faced prosecution for treating the boy
#### Saving the French Wine Industry
- Napoleon III came to Pasteur to solve French wine spoiling in transit
- Pasteur realized this was due to bacterial contamination
- But boiling wine to kill bacteria made it taste terrible.
- Pasteur discovered that at 55 degrees, bacteria died without the taste being ruined.
- This process was then called pasteurisation.
- Lesson: Experiment, precise measurement
#### Rescuing the Silk Industry
- Napoleon III asked him to help the silk industry which faced a mysterious silkworm disease.
- Pasteur worked to find the infection (3 years+), because there were multiple sources.
	- Could come from the worms and from the leaves.
- Lesson: Pasteur kept detailed notebooks, recorded every experiment and failures. Learned from them.
- Scientific mindset begins with keeping careful records.
- Persistence: 6 years
#### Personal Life Tragedies
- Pasteur had 5 children but 3 died young.
- 1859, Pasteur lost a daughter to typhoid.
- Science is a human enterprise.
#### A Benefactor of Humanity
- Louis Pasteur was a humanist, always working towards the improvement of the human condition.
- He was a free man who never hesitated to take issue with the prevailing yet false ideas of his time.

### Summary
1. Science and scientists learns by:
	1. observing,
	2. finding an explanation for observations
	3. developing an experiment to prove their explanation is correct
2. Sometimes progress comes from accidents
3. Pasteur changed our lives for the better. Science at its best helps us live better lives.

"A bit of science distances one from God, but much science nears one to Him... The more I study nature, the more I stand amazed at the work of the Creator."

### Fritz Haber (1868-1934)
- German chemist, nationalist
- Nobel Prize in Chemistry, 1918
- Invented the Haber-Bosch process
	- Ammonia synthesis for fertilizer
	- Massive improved food production and security
- Developed chemical weapons during WW1
- Responsible for the lives of billions, and the deaths of millions
#### Was Haber an Evil Person?
- Not a bad scientist
- He was a patriot
	- Everything was for Germany
	- He thought chemical warfare would shorten the war, saving more lives
	- Shunned by family and scientific community due to chemical weapons
	- Irony: Had to leave Germany when Nazis came to power as Haber was Jewish
	- Bigger irony: Nazis built on his chemical technology to create chemicals used in gas chambers during the Holocaust
#### Stopping the next Haber?
- A simple matter of net benefit?
	- "Billions owe their lives to him"
	- Does this justify war crimes?
- It didn't have to be Haber
	- Someone else could've hastened ammonia production
	- Someone else could've weaponized chemicals
- Lesson: The practice of science may be rational and amoral, but the practitioner will always be a moral agent
	- Driven by personal circumstances, motivations, and social realities
