# Technology and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)
How is IPR as an issue related to science, technology, and society? Why is this important?
Recall: the information/technological wave
- digital technologies
- more emphasis on research and development, innovation and invention
### Ease of production
Back then: Vinyl, VHS tape, casette, CDs
Now: Digital albums, Spotify
### Ease of Storage
- Storage is getting cheaper, from kilo to mega to gigabytes
- Google Drive
### Ease of Dissemination
- Instead of paper, data and information may be spread digitally (and papers can be scanned)
- P2P Connections, Bluetooth, WI-FI
### Creations as Properties?
- Intellectual property is a generic term that refers to intangible objects which acquire their value primarily from creative efforts, e.g.:
	- Literary works, artistic productions, scientific discoveries, plans for inventions and designs
- "Intellectual property rights are the rights given to persons over the creations of their minds. They usually give the creator and exclusive right over the use of his/her/their creation for a certain period of time" - World Trade Organization
- IPR manifests in all three kinds: Trademarks, patents, copyrights
##### Trademarks
- A word, phrase, symbol, or design that identifies and distinguishes a product from another
##### Copyrights
- Rights given to creators of original literary, scientific, and artistic works
- Can apply to any creative/original work
###### Plagiarism
- Uncredited use (both intentional and unintentional) of somebody else's words or ideas.
- Unquestionable: Buying, stealing or borrowing a paper; hiring someone else to write your paper; copying large sections of text from a source without quotation marks or proper citation
- Gray area: close paraphrasing, building on somebody else's ideas (so citation is important!)
##### Patents
- Rights over the manufacture, use, and marketing of inventions
###### Free-riding problem
- Product available to all
- Inventor receives minimal profit
- Inventors lack incentives to innovate because of low ROI
###### Secrecy Problem
- Product processes no shared
- Higher production cost
- Inefficient use of resources in "reinventing the wheel"

- Inventor is given monopoly -> compensation
- Monopoly is for a limited amount of time -> innovation

NOTE: Patents can also cover ideas, designs, and plans that have never been produced.

### Brief History
- Recognition of rights of inventors to their inventions
	- 1300s in England
	- 1400s in Venice
	- 1700s in USA
	  1789 in France
- 1710 -> Statute of Anne - modern concept of copyright based on this document
- 1886 -> Berne Convention - international recognition of copyright
- 1994 -> Trade-related aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) - International IP agreement
