### The experience of science
- When did you first encounter science?
- In what form and manner did you experience it?
- How have you encountered science, ever since?

Science is simply organized curiosity. Some of us tend to be more curious and others.

### Heraclitus
"Nature loves to hide" - Graham, 2023.
1. Nature is willing to shed her veil for Science.
2. Science is a "rediscovery" of something already in Nature.
3. Science deals with a "physical" world where Nature exists.
4. This physical world is experienced "empirically".

### Science is many Things
It can be a:
- process
- perspective
- endeavor
- institution

### Aristotle
- The first "Natural Philosopher"
- Logic:
	- Philosophia - love of wisdom
	- episteme - knowledge
	- theoria - contemplation, speculation
#### Logic
- Logic is an assessment of nature.
- A way of thinking that utilizes reason.
- Knowledge: what you know and accept to be real. Can come from:
	- Belief
	- Research
#### Nature
- Belief
	- Experiential
	- Personal
	- Cannot be disproved
	- e.g. "I believe dragons are true."
	- Infallible Fact
- Research
	- Methodical
	- Universal
	- Open to testing
	- e.g. "What could explain dragons?"
	- Circumstantial Fact
#### Claim Testers
Strategies to appraise any information asserted involve:
- Intuition - gut feeling
- Authority - credible source
- Logic - systemic reasoning
- Evidence - verifiable information

### The Hypothesis
#### The Birth of a Hypothesis
- Information is used to form a hypothesis, which becomes a theory over time through time and testing if not disproven.
- "No amount of data will prove a hypothesis to be true. They only fail to disprove it." - Karl Popper
- You do not accept a hypothesis/theory, you only fail to challenge it.
#### The Death of a Hypothesis
- If an old theory has the following critical anomalies:
	- Contradictory data
	- Prediction failure
	- Is inadequate or non-encompassing
	- A simpler, more elegant model exists
- A paradigm shift occurs, which eventually leads to a new framework/theory.
- "The disruption of recognized thinking brings forth unexpected new ideas encompassing old and new data, birthing a new paradigm."
##### Case in Point: The Galileo Affair
- Old theory: Geocentrism
	- By Ptolemy of Alexandria
	- Based on Aristotelian concept of nature
	- Earth is at the center of the cosmos
	- Other celestial objects revolve around the earth
	- Evidence is based on everday experience with the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars.
- The critical anomaly: The Sun at the Center?
	- As early as 3rd Century BC: Aristarchus of Samos
	- Proposals from medieval Islamic scholars
	- First geometric model by Nicolaus Copernicus
	- Heliocentric model: Sun at the center
- Contradictory Data: Galileo's Findings
	- Galileo's version of the telescope led to better astronomical observations
		- Solar rotation
		- Phases of Venus
		- Moons of Jupiter
	- Disproved Aristotle's ideas that the heavenly objects are perfect circles/spheres
	- Evidence in support of the Copernican model
- Implications of the Galileo findings
	- The Church found the Ptolemaic model compatible with Biblical passages
	- Tycho Brahe tried to blend both geocentric and heliocentric models
	- Galileo was steadfast with his observations, earning the ire of the Church
	- The Church during this time was in upheaval due to the Reformation
	- Contrarian ideas deemed as a challenge to Church authority, thus are heretical
		- Even Galileo's writings, even if non-theological in nature
	- Galileo faced Church inquisition twice
		- Second inquisition found him guilty of heresy, was condemned to life under house arrest
	- Kepler's planetary model gave more pro-heliocentrism evidence
	- Later observations and physical concepts (e.g. Newtonian mechanics) upheld the validity of heliocentrism.
- At this time, heliocentrism said that the sun is the center of the universe - this has since been proven untrue.
#### Paradigm shift: What's at the center
- Now we know that the Sun is at the center, BUT:
	- Center of its own planetary system only
- What is at the center of the Universe?
	- Does the Universe even have a center?
	- We don't have an answer, though there are many speculations.
