### Weighing Lives
##### From Nature to the Individual: The "Natural Order" and the Universal Order
Social Darwinism:
- The perceived "logic" of the natural world applies to human society.
- Adaptation/Evolution = Survival
- The powerful will survive and the weakest will diminish.
- Survival of the fittest.

Social Darwinism promoted the dominance of the caucasian race. Justifying colonialism and the "universal standard" of the "ideal" human.

Eugenics or racial improvement originated from social darwinism.
- Who has the right to reproduce?
- What is a "perfect" human?
- Who belong and who are outcasted?

Domination of Nature -> Domination o the Human "Other" -> Ownership

### The Unconditional Right to Shelter
##### Chico River Dam Project
- A series of hydroelectric dams that aims to provide Luzon with lower electricity at the expense of indigenous communities
- Dam project is funded by the World Bank
- On the business side of things, cheaper and consistent electricity supply will entice foreign investors to establish/support industries in the Philippines
- In the 1970s, indigenous communities of Kalinga fought against the project
- The project will displace communities in Kalinga and will also endanger their cultural heritage and livelihood.
- Apo Macli-ing Dulag: "Such arrogance to say that you own the land, when you are owned by it! How can you own that which outlives you? Only the people own the land because only the people live forever. To claim a place is the birthright of everyone. Even the lowly animals have their own place... how much more when we talk of human beings?"
- As we become more connected, the need for extraction intensifies.
- People from developing countries are exposed to chemicals from mining, polluting air, and waterways.
- As our networks become more interconnected, this opens what Mbembe calls "A Second Creation".
### Techno-animism
- "contemporary technological religions are expressions of animism. But they also differ from it inasmuch as they are governed by the principle of artifice (deception), whereas ancestral animism was governed by that of vital force."
- Panopticon is a type of prison system developed during the 18th century.
- Michel Foucault's *Discipline and Punish: Birth of the Prison* (1975)
- The guard at the central tower and the prisoners
	- pan = all, optic = seeing
	- Surveillance without being seen
	- Can be related to 1984:
		- Big Brother is watching you.
- Achille Mbembe's Participatory Panopticism:
	- The feeling of being watched
	- Self-regulation, self-censorship
	- Status quo
	- Following the "normal"
- The "Other" cannot e trusted and should be watched.
- Distrust with one another.
### Theology of Necrosis
- Impossbility, incompatibility, and disconnect
- Antagonistic categories: good and bad, friends and enemies, majority and minority
- Against universal rights
- Colonial order and the colonial "other"
- Rejects a common dwelling


"To return to the body is also to come back to earth, understood not as a land, but as an event that, in the end, fundamentally defies the boundaries of states. Understood in this way, the earth belongs to all its inhabitants, without distinction of race, origin, ethnicity, religion, or even species. It pays no attention to the blind individual or to the naked singularity. It reminds us how much each body, human or otherwise, however singular it may be, bears on and it itself, in its essential porosity, the marks not of the diaphanous universal but of commonality and incalculability."
- For Mbembe, we need to go back to the body which can reconnect us with the Earth and enable us to create ways for a planet-centered thinking.
- Body in this context is not the individual human body but the nexus of interconnectedness that creates the Earth as a whole.

### The Earthly Community
- "A novel planetary body that opens the possibility that the Earth can be conceived anew."
- History centered not on "(his)tory", or the history of humankind but the history of the nexus of beings that created/make our existence possible.
- In-common: Mutuality, solidarity, and recognition of common vulnerabilities.
	- "learn to live in bio-symbiosis"
- Remaking of the world
