### Prometheus and the Industrial Revolution
- The gift of fire and metalworks.
- The second agricultural revolution in Britain.
	- Increased agricultural surplus through agricultural technologies.
		- wired fences, threshing machine, seed drill, moldboard plow, and selective breeding.
- The Industrial Revolution created new ways of production, developed industrialized cities, and encouraged migration.
	- Cotton Gin
	- Power Loom
	- Steam Engine
	- Lightbulb
		- Changed architecture, no more need to rely on windows for light
		- Increased working hours, enabled nightlife
- Also the increase of private property rights.
- Technology = evolution
- Capitalism, accumulation, division of labour, and surplus.
	- Division of labour was due to long working hours on specialized roles, caused the domestication of women.
- Humanity was able to utilize nature for its agenda, and the separation of humans from the natural environment became a possibility. The humans became workers alienated from themselves.
	- Humans tend to escape mortality, which is to be separated from the natural environment.
	- Hierarchy
	- Selling one's labor and time.
		- As the working class did not own the means of production.
		- The capitalists increased revenue while reducing wages to maximize profit.
- The industrial revolution did not just change human society but also non-human beings.
	- e.g. Black Peppered Moths became more vulnerable over time due to factories making the barks black, causing mutations as they try to evolve.
- In the metaphor: when Prometheus gave man fire, there was development. But at what cost?

### Colonialism
- Colonial legacies such as religion, language, education, political and economic systems contributes to the established of a universal order.
	- Universal order: simplification of human society
- Forced the natives to assimilate into the colonial state and leave their animistic/pre-colonial beliefs
- Land dispossession and the loss of identity.
	- Living within two spheres of power (Aguilar Jr., 1998)
	- Identity is connected to the land.
- Intensified human vs. nature
- The introduction of capitalism, market, and globalization.
- Old money can be traced back to the Spanish colonial times (e.g. the Ayalas).
- The native will always aspire to take the shoes of the colonizer.
	- A symptom of colonialism.
### From Fire to Computation
- The Earth remains to be conquered and appropriated.
	- A New Epoch: from fire to the computational age.
- Technological evolution as part of human evolution
	- Fire
	- Wheel
	- Gutenberg's Press
	- Atomic bomb
- Technological evolution constitute the passage to another Earth.
- Technology is such an extension of ourselves that we are functionally cyborgs.
### Brutalism
- Brutalist architecture is an example of how capitalism appropriates meaning
	- Capitalism tends to dazzle us with grandeur
- How is it enabled? How is the concrete acquired?
	- Recent news: Antipolo flooded due to the quarries used to extract materials for concrete.
	- Even one hectare of quarry affects water flow
- Contemporary capitalism crushes and dominates all spheres of existence.
	- Techno-molecular colonialism
- Artificial human and human machines
	- Humans depending on language model to create sentences. AI language model depending on humans to be more human-like
- Different forms of dehumanization, extraction, and exploitation.
	- Labor
	- Environment
	- Surveillance
		- Borne out of mistrust, belief that someone will do bad
		- Who defines "bad"? What is "masama"?
- The Earth as a market creation
	- Power of dazzlement
	- Power of institution
	- Power of catastrophe
		- Capitalism thrives in catastrophe, as it needs it to justify itself
		- It convinces you that you need *it* now
- The Future of Reason and Freedom
	- We are no longer reasonable, our perspective is limited.
- Inhospitable environment
##### Capitalism
- Capitalism tends to separate people in a hierarchy:
	- Social and economic hierarchy
	- Class consciousness tends to depend on the circumstances.
		- e.g. People in privilege tend to have a class consciousness that tends to be vindicative of their own positions and do not understand those lower class.
	- It fosters disconnect with people.
	- Why don't we question: "why does socioeconomic class exist in the first place?"
- As development occurs, it deprives.
	- To concrete: you deny the soil its purpose! (haha Metal Gear)
### The Universal Right to Breath
- Earth as the last utopia and the dead end.
- Earth as a general reservoir of life.
- The Earth as a composition, an ongoing negotiation.
	- How do we achieve a utopia without considering fellow life not in our tribe?
- Making room for all inhabitants of Earth.
- Restoring a synergistic relationship between humans, non-humans, and the environment.
- Planet centered-thinking
- When global warming overtakes us, where else is there to do?
- If capitalism dominates all spheres of human existence, how do we separate ourselves from it?
