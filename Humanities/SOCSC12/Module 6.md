### Symbolic Interactionism and Symbolic Meaning
- Even the ownership of a specific brand is a symbol of consumption
##### A reminder of life: the politics of statues and monuments
- Jose Rizal's controversial politics
	- Retraction published a day after the Dec. 30 1896 execution.
- The Lamp and the Elite in Rizal's El Filibusterismo
	- Rizal as counter-revolutionary, traitor?
- Rizal's relevance to the Americans
	- Filipinos have the aspirations of being professionals, passive
- Why is Andres Bonifacio not the bonafide National Hero of the Philippines?
	- Historians would say that we have multiple national artists.
##### Colonial Legacies: Embedded in Symbols
-  A history of Catholicism
	- The 'pagan' salvation through narratives of 'civilized' actions
- A reminder of the erased pre-colonial past
- "Taga-bundok" at taga-bayan
- A space to spark a sense of community and a negotiation of space
- The friction within the outcomes of multiple colonialism
- The colonial monument beyond the colonial symbol
- How do we redefine meaning/symbols?
- e.g. The removal of comfort women statue in Manila Bay
	- The significance of the history of comfort women is tarnished in favour of Japanese investments
- e.g. Confederate, Columbus statues destroyed in the US during the BLM protests
##### Trajectories of Colonial Language: Death or Negotiation?
- War of Translation and War on Translation
- The Filipino resistance to language
	- The mother tongue and acquired languages
	- The lack of command the creation of new words and meanings
- The role of the English language in capturing the imagination of Filipinos, creating a barrier between critical thinking and language appreciation.
- The "slang" as the national language:
	- Language of the streets
		- A naturally occurring development in language
		- Transcends the imagined hierarchy of language.
	- Filipino English is vastly different from American English
		- e.g. "salvage" -> negative in Filipino English, as a result of the Marcos regime
- "Language is a war zone." - Ngugi wa Thiong'o
- As Ngugi argues, when we use the English language, integrate it with our mother language, and accept the development of slang, are we expanding the power of the English language?
- In a globalizing/ed world, the hegemony (or dominance) of the English language endangers other languages around the world. Bringing some into extinction because speakers prefer to use other languages.
	- Empowerment vs Enslavement
##### Language of Ideology and the Propaganda Machine
"Bagong Pilipinas, Bagong Mukha"
- Network of power positions - Garcellano, 1990
- The language of the streets or slang, as Joaquin and Rafael stated, happens within a natural cycle of language evolution.
- This happens faster than any academic institution's imposition on language.
- In the midst of our deteriorating quality of education in the country, how can we understand the language of the streets?
- How can we present a decolonial future within the fragments of the legacies of figures, statues, and monuments?
