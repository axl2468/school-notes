### Anibal Quijano
- Peruvian Sociologist and Humanist
- Coined the term Coloniality of Power and Coloniality of Knoweldge. He is considered one of the foremost thinkers on Decolonization and Post-colonialism
- Author of Nationalism and Capitalism in Peru: A study in Neo-Imperialism
- Quijano's works greatly influenced leading scholars of Decoloniality and Decolonization such as Waleter Mignolo and Arturo Escobar.
### New Mental Categories
- The idea of "race"
	- Hierarchical
	- Perceived as natural
- Superior and inferior
	- Civilized and barbaric/savage
- Colonizer and colonized
- "Imposition of a new reality through religion, education, and the assimilation process, situating the native into two spheres of power (Aguilar Jr., 1998) and the Labyrinth of Solitude (Paz, 1950)."
- The only way for the colonized to survive is to assimilate
	- Syncretization, folk catholicism
- In Philippine history, just like in Latin America, the Spanish government imposed a hierarchical system where the Peninsulares (Spain born z) are on the top while the Indio and Negrito are on the bottom.
- The hierarchy influenced both politics and social life.
- Racist distribution of work
	- Polo y servicio recruited Filipino men
- The role of women in society
- Even though the natives are at the bottom of the hierarchical ladder, they are still the majority population wise.
- e.g. Catholicism
	- The internalization of the Spanish race as closer to God
### Homogenizing for the sake of coloniality
- All Christianized natives in the Philippines became Indios
- All of the members of the indigenous groups in the Americas became Indios.
- Singular identities is easier to control.
- This is also part of the assimilation process where the reality of the colonized is reconfigured.
	- Introducing a new world view and boxed meaning making = to civilize, modernize
- "Any given society is a power structure... Imagined as a community some homogenization of people has been accomplished on a basic level."
- Examples of how are we homogenized, the OFW
	- Typical jobs of OFWs:
		- Caretaker/DH
		- Nurse
		- Seaman
		- Engineer (Saudi)
		- Maintenance staff
		- Driver
		- English Teacher
		- Factory Worker
		- Entertainer
		- Service/Hospitality
	- Compare it to how we would see as the typical job of a British person in London?
### Filipino Identity and Nationalism
- The Filipino language and the languages in the archipelago
- Filipino as a homogenizing term
	- Homogenization in the PH is somewhat unsuccessful as there is still resistance against the Filipino as an identity
		- Moro resistance
		- Ethnicity as core resistance
- National identity is unnatural, an imposition, and a colonial legacy
	- Became a necessity because of PH revolution
	- Defended by ideas on a "globalized world"
# Aesthetic of Utopia, Meaning and Doing the Impossible
- Not all aesthetics are utopia, but all utopias are aesthetic.
- When you imagine a new utopia by creating a new aesthetic, you break out of the system and you achieve the "impossible".
- When you imagine a utopia, you say that the world can be better. We imagine an alternative.
- We need to question structures in our society, because otherwise, how do you think of something novel?

### Audrey Lorde
- The master gives you the tools to serve them
- Can the master's tools dismantle the master's house?
- Can I use the knowledge from the system to fight the system? Or think outside of the system to create tools that the master does not know.
- Lorde: The master's tools will never dismantle the master's house!
- Utopia -> how can we rethink society so that we can manifest this existence?

Frustrations: Competition in this world, we prioritize ourselves
