### Anthropology
- from the Greek anthropos ("human") and logia ("study")
- cultural relativism
- The science of humanity
	- Human in society
	- Human and the natural environment
	- Culture
	- Ideology
	- Non-humans
- Four field approach
	- Biological Anthropology
	- Cultural Anthropology
	- Archaeology
	- Linguistics
- Applied Anthropology

Anthropology navigates around the network within our existence. Anthropology uses knowledge produced by other disciplines:
1. Feminist Theory
2. Marxism
3. Postmodern Theory
4. Social Constructionism
5. Critical Race Theory

But at the same time, being critical and reflexive of the limitations and implications of these theories.

### Intersectionality
- coined by Kimberle Crenshaw to explain the marginalizaion of African-Amercian Women
- Confronts the nexus of our socio-cultural, socio-economic, and socio-political systems.
- It asks: How and why are things this way?
- Intersectionality as a lens provides us with a holistic perspective on the current condition of our lived reality.
	- When asking a question, intersectionality finds the networks of factors that we can use to construct a sense of reality.
It looks into:
- Power relations and power structure
	- Hierarchy
	- Patriarchy
	- Western hegemony
- Social Constructs
	- Gender and gender roles
	- Race, nations, countries
- Broad global forces
	- Capitalism
	- Globalization
	- Colonialism
- Performance
	- Front stage and back stage
	- Interactions

Reality is not universal anymore.
### Exit from Democracy
- Abstract universals (don't really exist)
- Migration and re-peopling
- Brutality of democracy
	- Integrated forms of violence
	- The state holds the monopoly of violence.
	- Through the military and the police
- Narratives and meaning-making
	- Terror and anti-terror, two sides of the same coin
	- When you are fighting against terrorism, you are using violence against those deemed as terrorists
- The mechanisms of the market is not democratic in itself.
	- Capitalism is not democratic.
	- We rely on the market.
	- Do we desire out of nothing or do we desire based on what the market dictates? Is choosing between a set of options freedom in itself?
- We can recognize the problem but we cannot do anything about it.

### The Colonial History of Anthropology
- In search of the "exotic", tribes untouched by "civilization".
	- Margaret, Mead, Bronislaw Malinowski, Clifford Geertz
- Weaponizing anthropology
- The discipline was used to justify the hierarchy of races.
	- Anthropology can be weaponized.
	- Present-day anthropology tries to veer away from his past actions
- Orientalism and The Other
	- Edward Said:
		- Misrepresentation - The West's perspective on the Arab world and the non-Western, "exotic" world.
- In our Filipino context:
	- Colonialism still permeates in Filipino society

Can you really speak to power?
- If we are democratic, can we speak without repercussion?
- Fear exists.

### The post-colonial, colonial Present
- The Philippines is a neocolonial state.
	- We have a tendency to try to appease other countries.
- Society needs inequality to function.
	- e.g. provincial wages are less than Metro Manila wages.
### Decoloniality
- Walter Mignolo:
	- "Liberation of knowledge, of understanding and affirming subjectivities that have been devalued by the narratives of modernity that are constitutive of the colonial matrix of power. Its main goal is the transformation of colonial subjects and subjectivities into decolonial subjects and subjectivities."
	- *On Decoloniality, The Conceptual Triad*
- Coloniality is a manifestation of injustice and the lack of equality within the post-colonial experience. In these injustices, we can see the mechanism of the colonial matrix of power.
- Decoloniality acknolwedges Arturo Escobar's defition of *Pluriverse* that "the world is a world of many worlds".
- A decolonial perspective develops a state of consciousness that promotes diversity within Filipino identities.
	- Being a Filipino in Metro Manila is different from being a Filipino in the US.
- A cultural shift, abolitionist, and critical to power.
	- Unlearning, relearning, liberation.
- Re-imagining and rethinking our present and our future.
- Empowerment to the marginalized.
- Decentralized power.
- Answers how we can avoid replicating colonial structures.

##### The Zapatista of Chiapas, Mexico as a self-organized community
"Continue in struggle, in resistance. The work still isn't finished. There are things to come in which the collaboration of the communities is necessary. We ask the new generations that they learn the organizational forms that they learn to organize from inside their towns and communities." - Zapatista Celebrate 29-Year Anniversary with Emphasis on the Youth

These communities are interconnected, and resist against the Mexican government. They detach from capitalism as they have their own market.

Another example of a self-organized community are the Lumads in the Philippines.

This does not mean radically turning away from all colonial influence, but rather to navigate around the legacies of colonialism (as a community effort) to avoid colonial structures from happening again.
