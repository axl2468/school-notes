Much like Sisyphus, we live in a world of absurdity, of only struggle
Camus teaches us to adopt an "all is well" mindset
To continue to live is to defeat that absurdity (i.e. to defeat the rock)

akin to the song Miley Cyrus' "It's the climb":
"There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb"

Somewhat compatible to Dasein:
Both choosing to live life despite knowing that it is limited (Dasein) or full of trials (Sisyphus)

"Ahh… So concludes the life and times of King Sisyphus. A fitting end to an existence defined by futile struggle. Doomed, from the very start… And I don’t regret a _SECOND_ of it! Hahahahaha, _ahahahahaha_, **AHAHAHAHAHAHA**, _**RAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA,**_ _**AAAHAAAHa**hahahaahaaa... *Explodes*_"
