Much like Sisyphus, we live in a world of absurdity, of only struggle

Camus criticizes existentialists as they try to find inherent meaning in meaninglessness, which is impossible in the face of paradoxical absurdity -> but its not about finding the solution

Two main responses to absurdity:
- Leap of faith (simple answers like "God gives you meaning") -> this is akin to spiritual suicide
- Suicide -> the physical kind
Camus presents a third option: "revolt"

Three characteristics of absurd life:
- revolt: we must not accept any answer or reconciliation in our struggle
- freedom: we are free to think and behave as we choose
- passion: we must pursue a life of rich and diverse experiences, good and bad

Camus teaches us to adopt an "all is well" mindset
To continue to live is to defeat that absurdity (i.e. to defeat the rock)

akin to the song Miley Cyrus' "It's the climb":
"There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb"

Somewhat compatible to Dasein:
Both choosing to live life despite knowing that it is limited (Dasein) or full of trials (Sisyphus)

"The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy."

"Ahh… So concludes the life and times of King Sisyphus. A fitting end to an existence defined by futile struggle. Doomed, from the very start… And I don’t regret a _SECOND_ of it! Hahahahaha, _ahahahahaha_, **AHAHAHAHAHAHA**, _**RAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA,**_ _**AAAHAAAHa**hahahaahaaa... *Explodes*_" - Sisyphus Prime from ULTRAKILL
