Verfallen: "pagkahulog" "fallenness"
Dasman: "the day" "The impersonal public"

Live as if you were already dead (not everyone wants to do this, too much responsibility, too much work!)
### Di Tunay na Pagtungo sa Kamatayan (Inauthenticity)
We see the world on the basis of how **they** see the world (they -> "sila" "impersonal public")
We don't think for ourselves -> makes our life easier
We look at death how others look at death -> pangyayaring malayo pa at hindi pa mangyayari ngayon

Ngunit ang kamatayan ay hindi mangyayari pa lamang -> from our birth, we are already dying

Therefore, treating death as we do right now is our coping mechanism

Lahat naman tayo ay namamatay -> knowing this does not solve the problem per se, but rather undermines the issue (like how one goes to a support group for their issues)
Death is trivialized

We are born lonely, and we die lonely
Our death is ours and ours alone (see Module 1)

### Tunay na Pagtungo sa Kamatay (Authenticity)
We have an experience that opens our eyes to our fallenness
This is called angst (pagkabahala) -> existential angst
e.g. In a funeral, you suddenly fixate on the tombstone -> you see your own name written on it, you feel the experience of death itself (the rotting, the parasites eating away at your flesh, the earth retaking your body)

rip raffy :(

Fear has a definite object (e.g. you fear the dog, so you avoid the dog); in angst however, how do you avoid death? how do you avoid the reality of the world being taken from you slowly?

This angst leads you towards authenticity towards death. -> pag-antabay ("anticipatory resoluteness")

#### Anticipating vs Waiting for Death
Analogy: pregnancy
- Actions taken are taken as if the child is already born (all actions taken are for that future event that the birth happens)
- That future event already affects the present -> hindi pa siya nanay, nanay na siya
- vs. naghihintay: nothing is being done, whatever actions don't matter in light of the future event (passive in nature)

Sa kamatayan: hindi ka pa patay, patay ka na
- Figure out not what you have to do, but what you want to do
	- e.g. Are you a student because you want to be a student, or because society tells you so?

Ang pag-antabay ay isang state ng "extended angst" -> this possibility might as well be my last possibility to actualize before death

Going towards death is not actualizing it, ang hamon ay nag pagbuhay kahit patay ka na
- Alam mo naman na mamatay ka, mapapanaw lahat ng iyong ginawa -> but I choose to live anyways! I choose to push the rock anyways! Absurd, but I do it anyways! (see Module 5-1)
- Ironically, the disadvantaged have a clearer view of what their life is (survival, putting food on the table)

Anticipation frees yourself from death, by accepting death as being part of who one is -> hindi mo na siya katatakutan
