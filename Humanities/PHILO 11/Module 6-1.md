Sa kabila ng absurdo, bakit pa ako magpapatuloy -> para saan ang aking ginagawa?

Same -> 
Other -> Kaiba
### Violence
**Background:**
Primarily, Levinas was a phenomenologist (he looked up to Heidigger, though he criticized him and felt betrayed when Heidigger became a Nazi)
His family was annihilated, only his wife and daughter survived and went to France
He did not understand the violence of the Holocaust and its lack of rationality

connatus essendi -> inherehent striving of every living being to persevere in its being, found in all living things; living things will do everything in its power to preserve itself

Violence is not only seen in a martial way, existing is violence

example: Flower taking resources from a corpse of a person -> the flower does not care about the person's gender, beliefs, desires, etc.; they only use the person to keep on living

The same wants to remain the same, so it is allergic of The Other

A friend in a group who does not want to go somewhere, you try to assimilate them to convince them (making them like the Self)

US' benevolent assimilation

Life is so much easier when surrounded by your alter egos - Narcissism

im the alpha im the leader im the one to trust
awoooooo!!!!

Flowey kill or be killed

Trump -> us vs. them, capitalized on the violent attitude of Americans

Everything is violent

From the violence in our centripetal movement, we enjoy (jouissance)

A child does not draw on the walls with malicious intent, but rather for their own innocent enjoyment

"I enjoy your company!" No, you enjoy yourself in their company
