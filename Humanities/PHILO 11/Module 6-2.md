Ego keeps making it about itself

Every experience of the world, of the elements and objects, lends itself to this dialectic of the soul conversing with itself, enters into it, belongs to it.

Every philosophy is an egology (to use Husserl's neologism) i.e. a study of the self.

May kakayahan tayong ikulong ang lahat sa konsepto at ideya

Every object in the world belongs somewhere in the classification scale (and this scale comes from us, to make it easier to make things like us)

As long as there is the Other, a person can only respond to this by making it an extension of themselves e.g. As Antipolo developed into like Manila, it lost its otherness

The body does not understand the spaghetti, it only understands the fundamental molecules and nutrients and it disposes of what is not needed as waste — the body does not have the capacity to handle the otherness

The point is—to make what is foreign domestic. In this way, violence is rooted in this natural phenomenon

In conversation—there is a difference when the person is in front of you rather than when you are talking about the same person e.g. can you talk shit about someone when they're right in front of you?

In a heated argument with your mother, there may be a moment where you begin to see your mother as a person rather than as a thing—why am I screaming at this person? You see the face, and you begin to see that you are doing something wrong if you continue to keep screaming at them. Their face becomes a metonymy for a whole thing that you will never understand fully.

The face can also be something that can be heard. The experience of the face is auditory, not visual. To perceive the face as the Other is a new experience, and to hear the commandment "You shall not kill!"—this commandment is a metonymy for the moral imperatives that command respect for the other.

The face says—hindi ako babae, lalake, Filipino, Hudyo, or any other category that you assign to the Other to reduce it to an object of violence. I am a person. From this epiphany, morality begins.

To have no sense of Other is to be a sociopath. They cannot see the face.

(Original reading)
"But if things do not resist the ruses of though, and confirm the philosophy of the Same, without ever putting into question the freedom of the I, is this also true of men?" Could you also do the same thing to men as you do to spaghetti, guyabano, and Antipolo?
